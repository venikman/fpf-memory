# U.RoleAssignment: Contextual Role Assignment
> Pattern `A.2.1` · Stable · Definitional (D) · Normative
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

> **Type:** Definitional (D)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

*with `Role Performance View`, `U.RoleStateGraph (RSG)`, and `Role Characterisation Space (RCS)` hooks*

**Builds on:** A.1 **Holonic Foundation**, A.1.1 **`U.BoundedContext`**, A.2 **Role Taxonomy**.  
**Coordinates with:** A.13 **Agential Role & Agency Spectrum**, A.15 **Role–Method–Work Alignment**, E.10.D1 **D.CTX (Context discipline)**, E.10.D2 **Strict Distinction**.  
**Lexical discipline.** *Context* ≡ `U.BoundedContext` (E.10.D1). *Appointment* is **colloquial only**; the canonical term in this specification is **Role Assignment** (see **CC‑LX‑1**).

**Mint vs reuse.** This pattern defines `U.RoleAssignment` and `U.RoleEnactment` and introduces the labels `Role Characterisation Space (RCS)` and `Role State Graph (RSG)` as intensional facets recorded in `RoleDescription` / `RoleSpec`. It reuses existing kernel terms (`U.Holon`, `U.System`, `U.Episteme`, `U.BoundedContext`, `U.Work`, `U.Method`) without changing their meanings.

**Intent.** Provide one, universal, **context‑local** way to say *who is being what, where (and when)* without altering what the thing **is**. The same grammar works for people, machines, software, teams, and **also** for knowledge artefacts (epistemes) when they hold **statuses** rather than perform actions.

## Content

## Problem frame

**Intent.** Provide one, universal, **context‑local** way to say *who is being what, where (and when)* without altering what the thing **is**. The same grammar works for people, machines, software, teams, and **also** for knowledge artefacts (epistemes) when they hold **statuses** rather than perform actions.

**Scope.**

* Defines **`U.RoleAssignment`** (binding a **holder** holon to a **role** inside a **bounded context**, optionally within a **time window**).
* Separates that binding from **`U.RoleEnactment`** (the run‑time fact that a piece of **Work** was performed under that assignment).
* Names the **Role Characterisation Space (RCS)** and the **Role State Graph (RSG)** as **intensional** facets of a Role (recorded in its `RoleDescription`, upgraded to `RoleSpec` only after tests exist).
* Declares **eligibility** constraints so Roles apply to the right holon kinds, **without badge‑of‑badge chains** like “TransformerRole is assigned to be AgentRole”. If your Context wants taxonomic inheritance between role names, express it with in‑Context role algebra (`≤`), not via chained assignments.
* Declares **eligibility** constraints so Roles apply to the right holon kinds, **without badge‑of‑badge chains** like “TransformerRole is assigned to be AgentRole”. If a Context intends taxonomic inheritance between role names, that relation is expressed in‑Context via role algebra (`≤`), not via chained assignments.

**Non‑goals.** No storage models, no workflows, no org charts. This is a **thinking Standard**; all semantics are notation‑free.
## Problem

1. **Type explosion.** Baking transient function into rigid types (“CoolingPump”, “AuditDeveloper”) violates parsimony and makes change brittle.
2. **Context drift.** Labels like *Operator*, *Process Owner*, *Standard* slide in meaning across teams/years when not tied to a **Context**.
3. **Actor vagueness.** Work logs state that things happened but not **who, in what capacity**, under which **local rules**.
4. **Category leaks.** Documents “do” tasks; deontic statuses are treated like run‑time states; capabilities are confused with permissions.
5. **Role chains.** Attempting “System ↦ TransformerRole ↦ AgentRole” hides intent and smuggles taxonomy into the data plane.

## Solution

### Canonical definition (notation‑free)

**`U.RoleAssignment`** is a **context-local assignment:

```
RoleAssignment ::=
  〈holder: U.Holon,
   role: U.Role,
   context: U.BoundedContext,
   window?: U.Window,
   justification?: U.Episteme,
   provenance?: U.Method〉
```

**Admissibility constraints (concept‑level; non‑deontic).**

* **Invariant RA‑1 (Locality).** `role ∈ Roles(context)`. The role’s meaning is exactly the one recorded in that Context’s RoleDescription/RoleSpec.
* **Invariant RA‑2 (No role‑of‑role).** `holder : U.Holon` and `holder ∉ {U.Role, U.RoleAssignment}`. (Roles/assignments are never holders.)
* **Invariant RA‑3 (Eligibility by role kind).**
  * **Behavioural roles** (agential/transformer/observer/speech and their refinements): `holder` is a `U.System`. Only systems can enact Methods and produce Work.
  * **Status roles** (epistemic‑status / normative‑status / service‑governance): `holder` is a `U.Episteme`. Epistemes never enact Work; they gate and justify.
  * Context refinements may tighten eligibility (e.g., “Approver must be human”) but are restrictions of the System/Episteme split (they do not weaken it).
* **Invariant RA‑4 (Window discipline).** If `window` is present, enactments occur within it. If `window` is absent, interpret the assignment as open‑ended **from an assignment time that is still traceable** (e.g., via an issuing `U.RoleAssigning` SpeechAct Work or other evidence).
* **Invariant RA‑5 (Separation).** A RoleAssignment confers **the capacity/authorization to act** (or the status to be recognised), but it is **not behaviour** (no Work implied), **not capability** (intrinsic ability lives elsewhere), and **not structure** (it does not participate in BoM / part‑of structure).

**Governance metadata (optional but first‑class when present).**

* `justification` carries *why* the assignment is valid in this Context (policy, standard, evidence Episteme).
* `provenance` carries *how* the assignment was issued or verified (method reference; may link to a `U.RoleAssigning` work step in the evidence graph).

**Didactic read.** Think **badge** (*who wears which mask, where, when*). The rules for the mask live **in the room** (Context).

**Two assignment modes.**
A RoleAssignment can be:
(a) Authoritative — issued by an authority or policy in the Context (often via a `U.RoleAssigning` SpeechAct Work); it can open a Green‑Gate for steps that require explicit authorization.
(b) Observational — an evidence‑backed classification that the holder occupies a Role in this Context (e.g., “Moon as SatelliteRole:IAU_2006”). Observational assignments never by themselves open operational Green‑Gates; they can gate decisions and analysis.
### Role Enactment (distinct from the assignment)

**`U.RoleEnactment`** captures the *run‑time* fact that **a specific piece of Work** was performed under **a specific Role Assignment**:

```
RoleEnactment ::= 〈work: U.Work, by: U.RoleAssignment〉
```

**Admissibility constraints (concept‑level; non‑deontic).**

* **Invariant RE‑1 (Actor reality).** `by.holder : U.System`. (Epistemes never enact Work.)
* **Invariant RE‑2 (Temporal fit).** `work.window` overlaps `by.window` (or `by.window` is open and contains `work.window`).
* **Invariant RE‑3 (Method gate).** For the `MethodStep` realised by `work`, `by.role` satisfies the step’s `requiredRoles` in that **same Context** (directly or via `≤` specialization inside the Context).
* **Invariant RE‑4 (Traceability shape).** `U.Work` records cite the performer as `performedBy = some U.RoleAssignment`. `U.RoleEnactment` is the conceptual (or derived) association `〈work, work.performedBy〉`; if a system persists it explicitly, it is 1:1 with Work.

*Reading:* **Assignments authorize; enactments happen.** That single sentence prevents months of muddled logs.

Role Enactment is the occurrence of `U.Work` performed by a `holder` while a valid `U.RoleAssignment` for the required Role is in an enactable state of its RoleStateGraph (A.2.5) within the same Context. Enactment is generic: it includes operational work (e.g., actuation) and communicative work (speech acts such as approvals).
### Role Characterisation Space (RCS) & Role State Graph (RSG)

These are **intensional facets** of a **Role**, not containers “inside” the Role. They are **recorded in** the **RoleDescription** (or **RoleSpec** once harnessed), per E.10.D2.

* **RCS (Role Characterisation Space).** A set of named characteristics that parameterise how the Role is understood in a Context (e.g., *AgencyLevel ∈ {None, Assisted, Delegated, Autonomous}*; *SafetyCriticality ∈ {SC0…SC3}*).
* **RSG (Role State Graph).** A directed graph of **named states** (nodes) and **admissible transitions** (edges) for the Role **within the Context** (e.g., *{Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked}*).

  * Each **state** has a **Conformance Checklist** (set of observable cues) supporting **Evaluations** (“X ∈ *Authorized*@context in W”).
  * RSG governs **role state transitions**, independent of any Work instance.

**Discipline.** Prefer the phrasing *“Role is **characterised by** RCS/RSG recorded in RoleDescription”*; avoid “Role **contains** its states.”
### Shorthand & reading

The canonical compact form used in prose and diagrams is:

```
Holder#Role:Context@Window
```

Examples:

* `PLC_17#Transformer:PipelineOps@2025‑04‑01..2025‑06‑30`
* `ISO_26262v2018#NormativeStandard:AutoSafetyCase` *(status role on an Episteme; no enactment)*

*The shorthand is didactic; the semantics are those of §§4.1–4.3.*
### No role chains (use algebra, not badge‑of‑badge)

Chained assignments are ill‑formed for encoding taxonomy (see **Invariant RA‑2** and **CC‑ELIG‑3**). Chaining hides intent and defeats validation.

Taxonomic inheritance between role names is declared explicitly in the Context’s role algebra. For example, if (per A.13) your Context treats every transformer as a kind of agent, state:

* `TransformerRole ≤ AgentialRole` *(in that Context’s role algebra)*

When a MethodStep requires two independent roles, express the conjunction where it belongs:

* the **MethodStep** requires both roles; the holder **wears two badges**, not a badge‑of‑a‑badge.
### Eligibility across holon kinds (normative matrix)

A Role’s **family** constrains **who can wear its badge**. Eligibility is part of **didactic hygiene** and prevents chains like “Transformer → Agent”.

#### Holder kinds (recap)

* **`U.System`** — any acting holon (person, device, software service, team, organization, socio‑technical unit).
* **`U.Episteme`** — any knowledge unit (document, dataset, model, standard, Standard).
* **`U.Holon`** — supertype; only **Systems** enact Work; **Epistemes** can only hold **status** roles.
#### Role‑kind × holder matrix

| Role kind (examples)                                                     | May be held by `U.System` | May be held by `U.Episteme` | Notes (eligibility refinements live in Context)                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agential** (e.g., *Agent*, *Decision‑Maker*, *Approver*)               |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Requires an RCS characteristic such as *AgencyLevel*; RSG should expose *Authorized/Active* states.                            |
| **Transformer/Constructor** (e.g., *Welder*, *ETL‑Runner*)               |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Performs Methods; produces Work; often requires *Capability* evidence.                                                         |
| **Observer/Measurer** (e.g., *Observer*, *Monitor*)                      |           **✓**           |              ✗              | Produces `U.Observation`; may be passive (probe) or active (test rig).                                                         |
| **Communicator/Speech** (e.g., *Authorizer*, *Notifier*)                 |           **✓**           |              ✗              | A behavioural role; produces `U.Work` typed as SpeechAct.                                                                      |
| **Service‑Governance** (e.g., *ServiceOffering*, *SLO‑ClauseCarrier*)    |             ✗             |            **✓**            | **Episteme** (catalog entry, policy). If a System “offers”, the *offer* is a SpeechAct; the *offering* is an Episteme.         |
| **Epistemic‑Status** (e.g., *Evidence*, *Definition*, *AxiomaticCore*)   |             ✗             |            **✓**            | Status roles for knowledge; never enact Work.                                                                                  |
| **Normative‑Status / Deontic** (e.g., *Requirement*, *Standard*)         |             ✗             |            **✓**            | Source of obligations; Work is checked **against** them, not enacted by them.                                                  |

**Invariant — RA‑3 (eligibility)** *(restated)*: RoleAssignments are ill‑formed if they violate this matrix. A Context may **tighten** (e.g., “Approver must be human”), never loosen.

**Conformance checks (easy to remember).**

* **CC‑ELIG‑1.** If `role.family ∈ {Agential, Transformer, Observer, Speech}`, then `holder : U.System`.
* **CC‑ELIG‑2.** If `role.family ∈ {Epistemic‑Status, Normative‑Status, Service‑Governance}`, then `holder : U.Episteme`.
* **CC‑ELIG‑3.** No “role of a role”: `role` is bound to a **holder**, not to another role or assignment.
### Role algebra within a single Context (meaning relations)

Role algebra 

The in‑Context role algebra relates **role types** inside **one** `U.BoundedContext`. It is **not** mereology. Its operators (`≤`, `⊥`, `⊗`) is specified normatively in **A.2.7 `U.RoleAlgebra`**.

A.2.1 relies on it for (i) `requiredRoles` substitution checks (`≤`), (ii) separation‑of‑duties validation (`⊥`), and (iii) conjunctive bundles (`⊗`), but does not restate the operator semantics here.
### Time & state transition calculus (windows, RSG, enactability)

**Assignments authorize**, **enactments happen** — in time. RSG governs the **role’s** state transitions; `window` governs the **binding’s** validity.

#### Windows and overlap

* **Window form:** `@t_start..t_end` (ends may be open).
* **RE‑2 (temporal fit)** *(restated)*: `work.window` lies within (or overlaps appropriately with) `assignment.window`.
* **Handover pattern:** Close `A#Role@..t` and open `B#Role@t..` — history is preserved by closing windows rather than deletion.
* **(Conformance hook.)** See **CC‑WIN‑1**: preserve history by closing windows rather than erasing RoleAssignments.
#### RSG gating of enactment

Each Role’s **RoleDescription/RoleSpec** defines an **RSG** with named states; some states are **enactable**.

* **Delegation.** Normative author‑facing requirements for `U.RoleStateGraph` structure (including enactability marking and per‑state checklists) and the shape of `StateAssertion` evidence are defined in **A.2.5**; A.2.1 only relies on the resulting enactment gate.
* **Invariant RE‑5 (RSG gate).** A `U.RoleEnactment` is valid **iff** at enactment time the `U.RoleAssignment` can be supported by a **valid StateAssertion** that the holder is in an **enactable** state of the Role’s RSG **in this Context**.
* **(A.2.5 hook.)** The Role’s `U.RoleStateGraph` (A.2.5) identifies enactable states and attaches a Conformance Checklist to each state; checklist verdicts can be recorded as `StateAssertion`s (see SCR‑A2.5‑S02/S03).
* **Example.** *SurgeonRole* states: *Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked*. Only **Active** is enactable. A pre‑op checklist produces `StateAssertion(SurgeonRole, Active)`.

**Practical reading.** *Badge valid* (window) ∧ *state is right* (RSG) ⇒ you may act.
#### Suspensions, revocations, probation

* **Suspend:** transition to a **non‑enactable** state (e.g., *Suspended*). Keep the assignment’s window open; enactment is blocked by **RE‑5**.
* **Revoke:** either (a) close the window, or (b) transition to *Revoked* (non‑enactable).
* **Probation:** a dedicated RSG state with limited enactability (e.g., only under supervision, modelled as an extra required role on Method steps).
* **Discipline (A.2.5).** RSG transitions are explicit; no implicit “back to Active”.
#### Typical temporal patterns (didactic)

* **Shift rotation.** `A#Role@08:00..16:00`, `B#Role@16:00..24:00` — clean handover, no `⊥` issues.
* **Shadowing.** `Trainee#Role@..` + `Mentor#SupervisorRole@..`; Method steps require **both** roles.
* **Emergency bundle.** `SoloOperator := Incision ⊗ Hemostasis ⊗ Suturing`; activate only under declared emergency (Context‑level policy).
### Integration with A.15 (Role–Method–Work alignment)

> **One line.** A `U.MethodDescription` names the roles it needs; a `U.Work` cites the concrete `U.RoleAssignment` that enacted the step; the RSG state + window gates that enactment.

#### Design‑time Standard (inside U.MethodDescription)

For every **MethodStep**:

* **`requiredRoles`** — a list of `U.Role` **from the same Context as the step**.
  *Example.* In `Hospital.OR_2025`, step “Make incision” has `requires: [IncisionOperatorRole]`.
* Role algebra in‑Context applies: if the Context defines `IncisionOperatorRole ≤ SurgeonRole`, then `requires: [SurgeonRole]` also admits holders of `IncisionOperatorRole`.
* **Separation of concerns.** Capability checks (does the holder *can*?) belong to `U.Capability` and resource limits; **authorization** belongs to `U.RoleAssignment` + RSG.
#### Run‑time check (inside U.Work)

A `U.Work` record provides (or allows derivation of) the fields needed to satisfy **CC‑ENACT‑1..3**:

* **`performedBy` =** a concrete **`U.RoleAssignment`** (not just a person/system name).
* **Window gate.** The Work timestamp falls inside the assignment’s `@Window`.
* **State gate.** At that timestamp, an **enactable** state for the assignment is proven by a **`StateAssertion`** (the checklist verdict for a named RSG state).
* **Role algebra gate.** The assignment’s `role` is either one of `requiredRoles` or a **specialization (`≤`)** thereof; bundles (`⊗`) expand to conjunctions; incompatibilities (`⊥`) forbid overlaps on the same holder.
#### Evaluation & acceptance (link to services & deontics)

* **Observation.** The Work produces `U.Observation`(s).
* **Evaluation.** A `U.Evaluation` compares Observations with **AcceptanceClause**(s) referenced by a **promise content clause** (`U.PromiseContent`) or a **RequirementRole**.
* **SoD hook.** If the step or evaluation demands independence (e.g., “not performed by its reviewer”), enforce via `⊥` between `PerformerRole` and `ReviewerRole` **in the same Context**.
#### Planning & scheduling (design‑time “who will enact”)

* **`U.WorkPlan`** (aka “WorkDescription” in prose) binds forthcoming steps to **candidate RoleAssignments** and time windows.
* **Checks before the fact.** Validate windows (no gaps/overlaps where disallowed), enforce `⊥`, ensure expected RSG state will be **enactable** at scheduled time (or flag a pre‑flight checklist).

> **Didactic cue.** Think **“Step asks for badges; Run cites a badge; Badge must be valid & green.”**
> (Badge = RoleAssignment; valid = window; green = RSG state with a fresh StateAssertion.)
### Cross‑Context bridges in practice (with CL penalties)

Cross‑Context role substitution is **Bridge‑only** and is specified in **F.9** (with CL/waiver regimes) and **B.3** (CL‑penalty routing).

A.2.1’s only rule is *no substitution by label*: any “`Role_B@B` satisfies `Role_A@A`” claim used for checking or enactment **MUST** cite an explicit Bridge (direction, CL, loss notes) and **MUST NOT** override in‑Context `≤`, `⊥`, or `⊗`.
### Everyday pattern snippets (didactic moves)

> **Use these micro‑moves to think and speak cleanly; no tooling required.**

1. **“Who can do this step?”**
   On a `MethodStep`, write `requires: [RoleX]`. In your head, expand: “Any `performedBy` whose `role ≤ RoleX`, with a **valid window** and **enactable RSG state**.”
   *Example:* `requires: [SurgeonRole]` and `IncisionOperatorRole ≤ SurgeonRole` ⇒ `Dr.Kim#IncisionOperatorRole:Hospital.OR_2025` is admissible **iff** Active.

2. **Handover without history loss.**
   Close one window, open another. Never delete.
   `Alex#IncidentCommander:SRE_Prod@08:00..12:00`
   `Riya#IncidentCommander:SRE_Prod@12:00..20:00`

3. **Independence by construction (SoD).**
   Declare `Developer ⊥ IndependentAuditor`. Then it’s **impossible** (by validation) to have overlapping windows on one holder for both roles.

4. **Supervision as bundle.**
   Model apprenticeship by requiring `Trainee ⊗ Supervisor` on sensitive steps, or by RSG state **Probation** that flips `enactable` only if `SupervisorRole` is also present.

5. **Same badge name in two Contexts.**
   `LeadEngineer:ProjectPhoenix` ≠ `LeadEngineer:DivisionR&D`. If you must relate, create a **Bridge** with CL & loss notes; never rely on the name.

6. **Documents don’t act; they frame.**
   Replace “the SOP executed X” with: `SOP_v4#RequirementRole:SafetyCase` and a `SpeechAct` “approve run” by `QA_Officer#AuthorizerRole:Plant_2025`.

7. **Window + state ⇒ permission.**
   Quick mental check: *badge valid?* (window) ∧ *state OK?* (RSG) ⇒ **go**; else **no‑go**.

8. **Communicative enactment (approval)**
`CAB_Chair#ApproverRole:ChangeControl@2026-05-01T10:05` performs a SpeechAct Work “Approve Change-4711”. Effect: moves ApproverRole’s RSG state from Authorized?→Approved and
   opens the Green‑Gate for the operational step “Deploy Change-4711” (performed by a different RoleAssignment).
## Archetypal Grounding (three disparate arenas)

**Goal.** Show that the same assignment **`Holder#Role:Context@Window`**, plus **RCS** (Role-Characterisation Space) and **RSG** (Role-State Graph), works uniformly for **operational systems**, **software/service operations**, and **knowledge governance**.

Natural systems note. Spontaneous physical phenomena (e.g., Moon orbiting Earth) are modeled as `U.Dynamics`, not as `U.Work`. An observational RoleAssignment like `Moon#SatelliteRole:IAU_2006` is valid classification but does not imply enactment of a method.

### Industrial operations (welding cell)

**Role (family).** `WelderRole` *(Transformer)*
\**RCS (illustrative characteristics).*

* `ProcessClass ∈ {MIG, TIG, Spot}`
* `QualifiedMaterial ∈ {Al, SS, Ti, …}`
* `MaxCurrentAmp ∈ ℝ⁺`
* `SafetyProfile ∈ {Standard, HotWork, ConfinedSpace}`

**RSG (named states).**
`Unqualified → Qualified → Authorized → Active → Suspended → Revoked`
(*enactable*: **Active** only)

**Assignments.**

* `Robot_SN789#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025@2025‑02‑01..open`
* `Robot_SN790#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025@2025‑02‑01..open`

**StateAssertions (via checklists).**

* `StateAssertion(WelderRole, Qualified, AssemblyLine_2025, @2025‑02‑01..2026‑02‑01)` — training & test weld coupons.
* `StateAssertion(WelderRole, Active, AssemblyLine_2025, @2025‑03‑01..open)` — daily pre‑shift checks + gas/torch inspection.

**Enactment (gated by RSG).**
A `U.Work` entry `W#Seam134` is valid only if `performedBy = Robot_SN789#WelderRole:AssemblyLine_2025` and an **Active** `StateAssertion` covers the timestamp. If the torch‑health checklist fails, RSG transitions `Active → Suspended`; further seams are blocked by **RE‑5**.
### Software & cloud operations (continuous delivery / SRE)

**Roles (families).**

* `DeployerRole` *(Transformer)* — authorises execution of deployment Methods.
* `IncidentCommanderRole` *(Agential/Speech)* — directs response and issues SpeechActs (declares incident states).

**RCS (illustrative).**

* `DeployerRole`: `Env ∈ {staging, prod}`, `ChangeWindow`, `RollbackAuthority ∈ {self, peer, CAB}`.
* `IncidentCommanderRole`: `OnCallTier ∈ {L1,L2,L3}`, `ServiceScope`, `PageDuty ∈ {primary, secondary}`.

**RSGs (named states).**

* `DeployerRole`: `Eligible → Authorized → Active → Suspended` (*enactable*: **Active**).
* `IncidentCommanderRole`: `OnCall → Engaged → Handover → Rest` (*enactable*: **Engaged**).

**Assignments.**

* `sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_Pipeline_v7@2025‑04‑01..open`
* `Alex#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod@2025‑04‑10T08:00..2025‑04‑10T20:00`

**StateAssertions (via checklists).**

* `DeployerRole/Active`: completed change ticket, green pre‑deploy tests, peer‑review check mark.
* `IncidentCommanderRole/Engaged`: accepted page, situational brief read, comms‑channel opened.

**Enactment.**

* A deployment `Work` is valid only with `performedBy: sCG‑Spec_ci_bot#DeployerRole:CD_Pipeline_v7` **and** `Active` state asserted for the moment of start.
* Declaring `Incident SEV‑1` is a **SpeechAct Work** performed by `Alex#IncidentCommanderRole:SRE_Prod` in **Engaged** state; it changes deontic conditions (e.g., elevates `RollbackAuthority`).
### Knowledge governance (standards & requirements)

**Roles (families).**

* `NormativeStandardRole` *(Normative‑Status Episteme)* — a document that is *the* standard **in this Context**.
* `RequirementRole` *(Deontic‑Status Episteme)* — a statement that **binds** behaviour in this Context.

**RCS (illustrative).**

* `NormativeStandardRole`: `Scope`, `Edition`, `ApplicabilityWindow`.
* `RequirementRole`: `BindingClass ∈ {shall, should, may}`, `TargetRole`, `AcceptanceClauseRef`.

**RSGs (named states).**

* `NormativeStandardRole`: `Proposed → Adopted → Effective → Superseded` (*enactable*: N/A — Episteme roles are **non‑enactable**; they gate others).
* `RequirementRole`: `Draft → Approved → Effective → Retired` (non‑enactable).

**Assignments.**

* `ISO_26262_ed2.pdf#NormativeStandardRole:AutoSafetyCase_2025@2025‑01‑01..open`
* `REQ‑BRAKE‑001.md#RequirementRole:AutoSafetyCase_2025@2025‑03‑05..open`

**Effects (gating, not acting).**

* A system’s **Work** (e.g., HIL test run) is **evaluated** against clauses referenced by `RequirementRole`.
* An **Approval SpeechAct** (by a CAB chair who is a `U.System`) may transition `RequirementRole: Draft → Approved`. The Episteme does not “act”; **Systems** act, **Epistemes** hold status.
## Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Socio‑tech**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Kernel** (A‑cluster).

* **Architecture bias (Arch):** treating roles/assignments as structural parts can smuggle function into mereology and break holarchies.  
  *Mitigation:* keep roles out of BoM/structure trees; close windows instead of deleting history.

* **Onto/Epist bias (Onto/Epist):** anthropomorphising epistemes collapses evidence into agency (“the SOP approved”).  
  *Mitigation:* only Systems enact Work; Epistemes may justify, constrain, and gate; enforce RE‑1 and CC‑SD‑2.

* **Socio‑technical bias (Socio‑tech):** role eligibility rules can silently encode exclusion, power asymmetries, or discrimination (e.g., “Approver must be X” with no rationale).  
  *Mitigation:* keep eligibility refinements explicit in the Context, recorded as Episteme policy, and review them under D.2/D.* ethics patterns; prefer capability/competence evidence over demographic proxies.

* **Pragmatic bias (Prag):** over‑localising role labels can fragment reuse and create naming drift.  
  *Mitigation:* require explicit `:Context` binding and explicit Bridges with CL/loss notes instead of silent equivalence.

* **Didactic bias (Did):** metaphors (“badge”, “mask”, “green gate”) may be misread as informal or security‑only.  
  *Mitigation:* bind obligations to the Conformance Checklist; keep metaphors as mnemonic only.
## Conformance Checklist (normative)

### SCR (compact, memorable)

> **Pass these and your RoleAssignments are sound.**

**Anchoring & locality**

1. **CC‑CTX‑1.** A conformant model/record **MUST** ensure that every RoleAssignment’s `role` names a role defined in the same `U.BoundedContext` as that assignment.
2. **CC‑CTX‑2.** Authors and validators **MUST NOT** assume cross‑Context equivalence by label; any cross‑Context relation used for substitution or checking **MUST** be represented only in **Bridges** (F.9).

**Eligibility & families**
3\. **CC‑ELIG‑1.** Validators **MUST** reject any RoleAssignment record where `role.family ∈ {Agential, Transformer, Observer, Speech}` but `holder :̸ U.System`.
4\. **CC‑ELIG‑2.** Validators **MUST** reject any RoleAssignment record where `role.family ∈ {Epistemic‑Status, Normative‑Status, Service‑Governance}` but `holder :̸ U.Episteme`.
5\. **CC‑ELIG‑3.** Validators **MUST** reject any RoleAssignment record whose `holder ∈ {U.Role, U.RoleAssignment}` (no badge‑of‑badge chains).

**Role algebra (in‑Context)**
See **A.2.7 `U.RoleAlgebra`** (CC‑ALG‑1, 2, 3).

**Time & gating**
9\. **CC‑WIN‑1.** Record‑keeping systems and models **MUST NOT** delete historic RoleAssignment records; they close windows instead. If `window` is absent, the record **MUST** retain a traceable assignment start time (e.g., via a `U.RoleAssigning` SpeechAct Work or other evidence).
10\. **CC‑ENACT‑1.** Conformant Work records **MUST** cite `performedBy = some U.RoleAssignment`; validators **MUST** be able to check that the Work interval fits the assignment window (or that an open‑ended window contains it).
11\. **CC‑ENACT‑2.** At the Work time, validators **MUST** be able to (a) locate/derive a **StateAssertion** supporting an **enactable** RSG state for the cited assignment, and (b) verify that the assignment’s `role` satisfies the executed MethodStep’s `requiredRoles` in that **same Context** (directly or via `≤`; `⊗` expands to conjunctions).
12\. **CC‑ENACT‑3.** Runtime gates and validators **MUST** block enactment while the assignment lacks a supporting **StateAssertion** for an enactable state (e.g., during **Suspended**).

**Strict distinction & category hygiene**
13\. **CC‑SD‑1.** Models and tools **MUST NOT** place Roles into BoM/structure trees; roles do not participate in mereology.
14\. **CC‑SD‑2.** Models and tools **MUST NOT** treat Epistemes as Work actors; validators **MUST** enforce **RE‑1** (`by.holder : U.System`).

**Lexical hygiene**
15\. **CC‑LX‑1.** Authors **MUST NOT** use *appointment* as a synonym for *Role Assignment* in normative clauses.

**Traceability**
16\. **CC‑TRC‑1.** From any `U.Work`, reviewers **MUST** be able to trace **performedBy → RoleAssignment → Role → (RCS,RSG) → Context** and retrieve supporting **StateAssertion** evidence.
### RSCR (regression harness)

> **Run these mental “diff checks” whenever you change roles, contexts, or states.**

**RSG & gating**

* **RSCR‑RSG‑E01.** After editing an RSG, verify that each enactable state still has a live **Conformance Checklist** and that historic **StateAssertions** remain interpretable (no silent renames).
* **RSCR‑RSG‑E02.** If a state flips *enactable⇄non‑enactable*, re‑evaluate pending or recurring `U.Work` plans (no hidden authorisations).

**SoD & windows**

* **RSCR‑SOD‑E01.** On adding `⊥` constraints, scan for overlapping assignments that newly violate SoD; schedule revocations or rescheduling.
* **RSCR‑SOD‑E02.** On removing `⊥`, confirm that governance rationale is recorded elsewhere (policy change Episteme).

**Context churn**

* **RSCR‑CTX‑E01.** When a Context edition updates, freeze prior RoleAssignments; create **new** assignments in the new Context rather than mutating old ones.
* **RSCR‑CTX‑E02.** Bridges referencing affected roles are reviewed for CL/loss adjustments.

**Eligibility drift**

* **RSCR‑ELIG‑E01.** If a role family changes (e.g., reclassifying *Offerer* from behavioral to status), audit all assignments for holder‑type violations.

**Trace continuity**

* **RSCR‑TRC‑E01.** Spot‑check that `U.Work → RoleAssignment → StateAssertion` chains still resolve after refactors.
* **RSCR‑TRC‑E02.** Randomly sample old incidents/runs to ensure reproducible authorisation verdicts.

**Name stability**

* **RSCR‑NAME‑E01.** If a role label changes, maintain the **role identity**; treat renamed labels as aliases inside the same Context rather than minting a new role unless RCS/RSG changed materially.
## Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| #      | Anti‑pattern          | Symptom                                    | Why it’s harmful                   | FPF fix (conceptual move)                                         |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A1** | **Global role label** | “Alice is Lead Engineer” (nowhere)         | Meaning drifts; untestable         | Always anchor to Context: `Alice#LeadEngineer:ProjectPhoenix`      |
| **A2** | **Role as part**      | BoM lists “Cooling Function”               | Category error (structure vs role) | Keep BoM structural; model `Pump#Cooling:ThermalMgmt`              |
| **A3** | **Document acts**     | “The SOP closed the ticket”                | Epistemes don’t enact Work         | Give the doc a status role; make a System enact the step           |
| **A4** | **Role chains**       | “Transformer assigned to be Agent”         | Hides taxonomy; defeats checks     | Use role algebra (`≤`) and/or require both roles on the Method step |
| **A5** | **Hidden state**      | Acting while *Authorized? Active?* unclear | Safety & audit gaps                | Use RSG with StateAssertions gating enactment                      |
| **A6** | **Edition blur**      | Context “ITIL” with no version             | Sense slippage                     | Context card must carry edition (E.10.D1/F.1)                      |
| **A7** | **Bridge‑by‑name**    | Equating roles across Contexts by label    | Cross‑context drift                | Use F.9 Bridge with CL & loss notes                                |
## Consequences

**Benefits**

1. **No type explosion.** Structure stays stable; function lives in RoleAssignments with small, local lattices.
2. **Traceable authority.** Every `U.Work` has a clean chain: **performedBy → RoleAssignment → Role → (RCS,RSG) → Context**.
3. **Safe heterogeneity.** Different Contexts can use the same badge name differently; conflicts are dissolved by locality and explicit Bridges.
4. **Didactic economy.** One mental form — `Holder#Role:Context@Window` — covers factories, clouds, labs, and libraries.
5. **Strong SoD.** Incompatibilities (`⊥`) and bundles (`⊗`) are first‑class; audits become mechanical.
6. **Assurance‑ready.** RSG + StateAssertions convert checklists into **explicit gates**; CL penalties quantify Cross‑context risk.
7. **Temporal honesty.** Windows encode the ebb and flow of assignments without history loss.

**Costs / discipline required**

1. **RoleDescription work.** Each Context needs a minimal RoleDescription (name, RCS, RSG, checklists).
2. **Bridge authorship.** Cross‑context work requires explicit Bridges with CL & loss notes.
3. **Vocabulary hygiene.** Teams must stop using context‑less role labels.

### Teaching distillation (60‑second recap)

> “Give every action a badge with a Context. The badge is a `U.RoleAssignment`: `Holder#Role:Context@Window`.
> The badge is valid in time (window) and green in state (RSG + StateAssertion).
> A Method step names the badges it needs; a Work cites the exact badge that enacted it.
> If a badge comes from another Context, cross with a Bridge and respect its CL penalty.
> Keep SoD with `⊥`, reuse expertise with `≤`, and require combos with `⊗`.
> Documents don’t act — they hold status roles; only systems enact Work.
> With this, factories, clouds, and knowledge all speak the same, small grammar.”
### So what? Adoption test (1 minute)

If a team claims to “use A.2.1”, a random audit sample should pass all of these in minutes:

1. **Badge locality:** every role label is always read as `Role:Context` (or explicitly bridged), never as a global name.
2. **Work attribution:** each sampled `U.Work` cites a concrete `performedBy = U.RoleAssignment`, not just a person/system string.
3. **Window + state gate:** at the Work time, the assignment window fits and an enactable RSG `StateAssertion` exists (or the run is correctly blocked/exceptioned).
4. **No badge‑of‑badge:** no assignment ever binds a `U.Role` or `U.RoleAssignment` as its holder.
5. **Status hygiene:** no Episteme (Standard/Requirement/Evidence) is ever an actor of Work; it only gates/justifies/evaluates.
## Rationale

* **Strict Distinction (A.7).** Keeps **identity** (Holon) separate from **assignment** (RoleAssignment), **behaviour** (Method/Work), and **knowledge** (Episteme).
* **Ontological Parsimony (A.11).** One universal binding, three tiny in‑Context relations (`≤, ⊥, ⊗`), no global role types.
* **Universal core (A.8).** The same mechanism works across systems (machines, software, teams) and epistemes (standards, requirements), demonstrated in §5.
* **Lexical discipline (E.10.D1 & E.10.D2).** Roles are **context‑local**; descriptions (RCS, RSG) are **descriptions of intensional roles**, not the roles themselves.
* **Assurance posture.** Windows + RSG + StateAssertions make authorisation explicit and reviewable; Bridges + CL make cross‑Context reuse explicit and risk‑graded (B.3).
