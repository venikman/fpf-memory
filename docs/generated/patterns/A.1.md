## Content

## Problem Frame

The first epistemic act in any discipline is to **point**: “that thing, not the background.” Physics calls the pointed object a *system*, biology an *organism*, information science an *artifact*, philosophy an *entity*. Reusing any one of these across domains drags hidden assumptions and yields nonsense like *“What is the mass of a system of equations?”* or *“Where is the network interface of a moral theory?”*
FPF therefore starts from a **minimal, domain‑agnostic root** that makes such category errors impossible **by construction** and gives engineers and managers a clean, uniform handle for composition, boundaries and interfaces.
## Problem

If FPF treats **system** as the universal root, two recurrent failure modes appear:

1. **Category Error** — physical affordances get projected onto abstract artifacts (ports on theories; kilogram‑mass of paradigms).
2. **Mereological Over‑reach** — part–whole calculus is applied to genuinely atomic entities (prime numbers, elementary charges), producing meaningless “sub‑parts.”

A robust kernel **separates identity from structure**: first say *what can be singled out*, then say *what has parts*.
## Forces

| **Universality vs Intuition** | Precision of a new root term (*Holon*) ↔ practitioner expectation of familiar words (*System*, *Theory*).  |

## Solution — A three‑tier root (Entity ⊃ Holon ⊃ {System, Episteme})

FPF adopts a **three‑tier root ontology** refining Koestler’s “holon,” with crisp boundaries and safe composition.

### U.Entity — Primitive of Distinction

Anything that can be individuated and referenced. **No structural assumptions.** Use when you need to name “a something” without committing to having parts.

> **Naming note (mint vs reuse).** `U.Entity` and `U.Holon` are minted kernel terms: they reuse familiar words but intentionally diverge from domain‑specific ontologies and DDD “Entity”, so we can reason cross‑domain without importing hidden assumptions.
### U.Holon — Unit of Composition

A `U.Entity` that is *simultaneously* **(a)** a whole composed of parts and **(b)** a part within a larger whole. Formally, `U.Holon ⊑ U.Entity`.
Well‑formedness constraints:

* **WF‑A1‑1 (Single boundary).** A holon has **exactly one** `U.Boundary` that separates it from its environment.
* **WF‑A1‑2 (Γ domain).** The universal aggregation operator **Γ** is defined **only** on sets of `U.Holon` (never on bare `U.Entity`).
* **WF‑A1‑3 (Γ scope).** A Γ‑application is scoped to a declared context and a single declared temporal scope (design **or** run); order/time are routed to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4).

These constraints make composition rules uniform across domains and prevent Γ from being misapplied.
### Interface primitives: U.Boundary & U.Interaction

Every holon is defined by **how** it is separated and **what** crosses the separation.

* **`U.Boundary`** — physical or conceptual surface delimiting the holon’s scope.
* **`U.Interaction`** — any flow of matter, energy, or information that crosses a boundary.
  **Canonical boundary kinds (with twin archetypes):**

| Kind          | Permitted exchanges             | `U.System` archetype               | `U.Episteme` archetype                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open**      | Matter, energy, information     | Microservice exposing a public API | Public wiki editable by anyone                                |
| **Closed**    | Energy, information (no matter) | Sealed cooling loop in a server    | Version‑locked theory accepting new evidence but fixed axioms |
| **Permeable** | User‑filtered subset            | Cell membrane regulating ions      | Legal code allowing specific amendment classes only           |

This pair (`Boundary`, `Interaction`) makes interfaces explicit, reviewable, and testable across domains.
### Inside/Outside decision procedure

To decide whether an entity **E** is *inside* a holon **H**, apply:

1. **Dependency test:** removing **E** breaks a core invariant of **H**.
2. **Interaction test:** **E** participates in causal loops wholly within **H**’s boundary.
3. **Emergence test:** **E** contributes to a novel collective property warranting **H** as a single unit.
   Fail all three → **E** is *outside*. This practical triage prevents “scope creep” and forces explicit modeling of environment vs interior.

> **Collections vs collectives.** A set/collection of holons is not itself an acting unit. If a grouping is expected to act, model it as a `U.System` holon with its own boundary and attach roles/methods/work to that system (see CC‑A1.6; details in A.2 and A.15).
### Archetypal sub‑holons

FPF fixes two **archetypal** specializations to ground cross‑domain universality:

| Subtype                    | Essence                                                | Home pattern |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **`U.System ⊑ U.Holon`**   | Physical, operational holon obeying conservation laws. | **Sys‑CAL**      |
| **`U.Episteme ⊑ U.Holon`** | Knowledge holon (axioms, evidence, argument graph).    | **KD‑CAL**       |

> **Agency rule.** Behavioural roles and executed methods/work attach to `U.System` holons only; `U.Episteme` is passive content. Any change to an episteme is performed by an external system acting across a boundary (cf. CC‑A1.5 and A.2/A.15).

*Naming guideline:* keep “**System**” and “**Episteme**” for practitioner comfort; reserve **Holon** for meta‑level discourse and formal signatures.
## Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Holonic slot | **`U.System` — Water‑pump**            | **`U.Episteme` — Scientific theory**            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity** | Pump #37 stamped on the name‑plate     | “Newtonian Gravitation”, 1726 edition           |
| **Boundary** | Cast‑iron casing; inlet/outlet flanges | Axiomatic scope and vocabulary                  |
| **Parts**    | Motor, impeller, seals, housing        | Axioms, definitions, theorems, datasets         |
| **Whole**    | Operable assembly that moves fluid     | Coherent body of knowledge predicting phenomena |

Showing the **same structural slots** filled by a machine and a theory demonstrates the **substrate‑independent universality** of `U.Holon`. This is the didactic “Tell–Show–Show” anchor required by the Style‑Guide for architectural patterns.
## Bias-Annotation — Boundary-first modelling risks

This kernel distinction is intentionally **boundary‑first**: it treats “where the boundary is” as a modelling decision that shapes everything downstream. That framing is powerful, but it can also smuggle bias if boundary choices are made implicitly or for political convenience.

| Lens | Typical bias risk | Mitigation in this pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Gov** | Boundary decisions become “org charts”, not defensible model choices. | Record boundary rationale in the working model and require the **Inside/Outside test** (A.1:4.4) for contested cases. |
| **Arch** | Over‑modularisation: every interaction becomes a “system” with hard edges. | Prefer **permeable boundaries** when the phenomenon is gradient‑like; keep the `U.Entity`/`U.Holon` split minimal and push dynamics into Roles (A.2) and Work (A.15). |
| **Onto/Epist** | Category error: treating knowledge artifacts as physical actors (or vice‑versa). | Keep `U.Episteme` passive; model transformations as actions of a `U.System` in role, acting via explicit carriers (see A.10). |
| **Prag** | “Holon” becomes jargon that slows teams down. | Use `U.System` / `U.Episteme` in day‑to‑day models; reserve “holon” for kernel‑level discourse (see naming guidance in A.1:4.5 and CC‑A1.8). |
| **Didactic** | Readers infer semantics from overloaded labels or inconsistent headings. | Keep canonical titles and the `U.*` prefixes explicit; avoid informal deontic language in normative clauses (E.8). |
## Conformance Checklist (normative)

| ID          | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                    | Purpose / Notes                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC‑A1.1** | Any modelled object that exhibits a part–whole structure **MUST** be typed as `U.Holon` or its subtype.                                                                        | Prevents applying Γ to atomic entities; makes aggregation well‑typed.                                                  |
| **CC‑A1.2** | Each `U.Holon` **MUST** reference exactly one `U.Boundary` and declare its boundary kind (*open / closed / permeable*).                                                        | Enables boundary inheritance and environmental Standards; aligns with the canonical boundary kinds introduced in A.1.  |
| **CC‑A1.3** | Domain patterns **MUST** explicitly subtype their root concept (`U.System`, `U.Episteme`, …) from `U.Holon`.                                                              | Ensures cross‑domain compatibility of aggregation and emergence patterns.                                              |
| **CC‑A1.4** | Inside/Outside decisions for any candidate part **SHALL** be justified by the three‑step test (Dependency → Interaction → Emergence) and recorded with the boundary reference. | Makes holon membership auditable and repeatable; uses A.1’s decision procedure.                                        |
| **CC‑A1.5** | Behavioural roles (**including** `TransformerRole`) **SHALL** attach only to `U.System` (the bearer), not to `U.Holon` in general and not to `U.Episteme`.                     | Preserves Strict Distinction and prevents category errors; episteme roles are classificatory only.                     |
| **CC‑A1.6** | Do **not** model acting groups as sets. If a grouping is expected to **act**, it **SHALL** be modelled as a **collective system** (with boundary, role, Method/Work).          | Distinguishes `MemberOf` (collection) from mereology; prepares for A.14 Portions/Phases.                               |
| **CC‑A1.7** | The universal aggregation operator **Γ** **SHALL** be applied **only** to sets of `U.Holon` within a single declared temporal scope (design **or** run) and context.           | Prevents “chimera” graphs; routes order/time to Γ\_ctx / Γ\_time (B.1.4).                                              |
| **CC‑A1.8** | Prose and diagrams **SHALL** follow the naming guideline: use **Holon** for meta‑level discourse; prefer **System / Episteme** in practitioner‑level statements.               | Reduces jargon friction; keeps signatures precise and text readable.                                                   |

> *Audit tip.* CC‑A1.5 is frequently violated when authors write “holon bearing TransformerRole”. Rewrite to “**system** bearing TransformerRole” or provide the explicit `U.RoleAssignment`. See A.2/A.15 for role mechanics.
## Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them — Manager’s quick checks

1. **“Ports on a theory.”** Treating a proof corpus as if it had physical connectors. *Fix:* model `U.Interaction` only across **boundaries**; for epistemes, interactions are **symbolic flows** via carriers and citations (see A.10), not power or mass.
2. **“Document edited itself.”** Assigning actions to an episteme. *Fix:* actions are executed by a **system bearing a role** (A.12/A.15); epistemes are transformed **via external transformers** acting on their **symbol carriers**.
3. **“Parts everywhere.”** Forcing a part–whole onto atomic entities (e.g., prime numbers). *Fix:* if no meaningful parts exist, stay at `U.Entity`; apply Γ only to `U.Holon`.
4. **“Scope ≡ section.”** Using “scope” as a text region rather than a modeled boundary. *Fix:* define a `U.Boundary` and state what crosses it (`U.Interaction`).

> **When in doubt:** first decide **what is a holon**, then state **its boundary**, then list **what crosses**. Roles and methods come *after* (see A.2 and A.15).

| **Eliminates category errors** across physical and abstract realms by cleanly separating identity (Entity), structure (Holon), and behaviour (Role/Method/Work). | Introduces the unfamiliar term **Holon**; mitigated by Tell‑Show‑Show pedagogy and dual archetypal examples (System/Episteme).  |
| **Unifies aggregation**: a single algebra Γ composes pumps, proofs, genomes, and teams under one roof.                                                           | Requires refactoring legacy “System‑only” language; addressed by A.2/A.3 role calculus and the Γ‑family in B.1.                 |
| **Predictable extension point**: CAL/LOG/CHR patterns add constraints without touching the core types.                                                      | Imposes discipline on boundary declarations; mitigated by boundary kinds and the Inside/Outside test.                           |
## Rationale — Cross‑domain corroboration (post‑2015, informative)

The separation **Entity → Holon → {System, Episteme}** is not only ontologically clean; it is **empirically validated across domains since 2015**:

* **Compositional open systems.** Category‑theoretic treatments show that *boundaried* components compose safely (decorated cospans, open systems). This mirrors Γ’s reliance on declared boundaries. *(Fong & Spivak, 2019; Baez & Courser, 2017)*
* **Microservices & bounded contexts.** Modern software architecture stresses strong service boundaries and local reasoning as the route to evolvability—our `U.Boundary` and Inside/Outside test encode the same discipline. *(Newman, 2021; Vernon, 2022)*
* **FAIR & provenance.** Data/knowledge communities require explicit distinction between **content** and **carrier**, and auditable provenance—precisely the System/Episteme + SCR split used in A.1/A.10. *(Wilkinson et al., 2016; Boeckhout et al., 2018)*
* **Digital Twin / Thread.** Engineering practice since late‑2010s emphasises the run↔design seam and boundary‑consistent aggregation of subsystems—formalised in our Γ‑family and boundary inheritance rules. *(Grieves & Vickers, 2017; NIST DT/Thread reports 2019‑2021)*
* **Layered control of CPS.** Standard‑based, multi‑rate architectures justify explicit holon boundaries and scale transitions—feeding directly into B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition. *(Matni et al., 2024)*

These streams converge on one point: **make boundaries and composition first‑class** and separate **what a thing is** from **what it is doing here‑and‑now**—the heart of A.1/A.2.
## SoTA-Echoing (post‑2015, informative)

This solution echoes several modern (post‑2015) research and engineering streams. We **adopt** their boundary‑and‑composition insights, but **reject** any requirement to commit to a single formalism (per Notational Independence).

| Stream | Representative sources | Adopt / Adapt / Reject | What we take (and what we diverge from) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compositional open systems | Baez & Courser (2017); Fong & Spivak (2019) | **Adapt** | Take the idea that composition should be explicit and typed; diverge by keeping the Core notation‑independent (no category‑theory prerequisite). |
| Software boundaries and bounded contexts | Newman (2021); Vernon (2022) | **Adopt** | Take boundary‑scoped meaning and ownership as the default; diverge by lifting “bounded context” to a kernel boundary concept rather than a software‑only practice. |
| FAIR / provenance for epistemic artifacts | Wilkinson et al. (2016); Boeckhout et al. (2018) | **Adopt** | Take provenance and carrier/content separation; diverge by modelling knowledge artifacts as `U.Episteme` (passive) rather than agents. |
| Digital twin / digital thread | Grieves & Vickers (2017); NIST DT/Thread (2019–2021) | **Adapt** | Take the run↔design seam; diverge by requiring a boundary kind at the holon level. |
| Systems/control criteria for emergence | Matni et al. (2024) | **Adopt** | Take emergence as a criterion for systemhood; diverge by requiring explicit boundary declarations even when “obvious”. |
## Relations

* **Builds / Grounds:**

  * **A.2 Role Taxonomy** — A.1 provides the substantial characteristic (`Holon`), A.2 introduces the functional characteristic (`Role` and `U.RoleAssignment`). Together they prevent role/type explosion and keep agency contextual.
  * **A.7 Strict Distinction (Clarity Lattice)** — A.1 supplies the *slots* (Entity/Holon/System/Episteme); A.7 guards their separation in prose and models, stopping Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier conflations.
  * **A.14 Advanced Mereology: Portions & Phases** — A.1’s holon substrate is the target of A.14’s edge discipline (`ComponentOf`, `ConstituentOf`, `PortionOf`, `PhaseOf`); only mereological subtypes build holarchies.

* **Interacts with the Γ‑family (B‑cluster):**

  * **B.1 Universal Algebra of Aggregation** — Γ is defined **on holons** and respects CC‑A1.\*; Γ\_ctx/Γ\_time carry order and temporal composition, Γ\_work handles resource ledgers.
  * **B.2 Meta‑Holon Transition (MHT)** — uses A.1’s boundary and Inside/Outside rules to decide when aggregation yields a **new** whole with novel properties.
  * **B.3 Trust & Assurance Calculus** — evidence attaches to carriers (SCR/RSCR) of epistemes; assurance levels depend on A.1/A.10 alignment.
  * **B.4 Canonical Evolution Loop** — operationalises the **design↔run** seam at holon boundaries; observation itself is an external transformation across a boundary.

* **Specialised by patterns:** `U.System` (Sys‑CAL) and `U.Episteme` (KD‑CAL) are archetypal sub‑holons that supply domain‑specific invariants while inheriting A.1’s boundary and aggregation duties. 

*Without the holon, parts drift; without the role, purpose evaporates.* (Carry this epigraph with A.1 to cue the A.2 hand‑off.)
