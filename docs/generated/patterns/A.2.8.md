# U.Commitment: Deontic Commitment Object
> Pattern `A.2.8` · Stable · Definitional (D) · Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

> **Type:** Definitional (D)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A → **A.2 Roles & Agency Kernel**
> **Refines:** A.2 (Role Taxonomy)
> **Builds on:** E.8 (authoring template), A.2.1 (RoleAssignment), A.2.6 (Scope & `Γ_time`), A.7 (Object≠Description≠Carrier), A.2.3 (`U.PromiseContent` as promise), A.15.1 (`U.Work`)
> **Purpose (one line):** Provide a minimal, reusable kernel object for deontic commitments (who is accountable, under what modality, in what scope/window, with respect to which referents, with which adjudication hooks), **explicitly separating the commitment object from its utterance descriptions** (A.7), so deontics stop “living” in naming patterns and become stable across A.6 and later governance patterns.

The word family “bind/binding” is used throughout FPF for **technical binding** (name/slot binding, parameter binding, etc.). This pattern introduces a narrower lexical constraint: **do not use “binding” as the Tech-level term for deontic governance relations.** Use **commitment** and model it as `U.Commitment`. If source material uses “binding contract/promise” rhetoric, rewrite it into explicit `U.Commitment` fields (`subject`, `modality`, `scope/window`, `referents`, and—when auditable—`adjudication`).

## Content

## Terminology: “binding” is overloaded (normative)

The word family “bind/binding” is used throughout FPF for **technical binding** (name/slot binding, parameter binding, etc.). This pattern introduces a narrower lexical constraint: **do not use “binding” as the Tech-level term for deontic governance relations.** Use **commitment** and model it as `U.Commitment`. If source material uses “binding contract/promise” rhetoric, rewrite it into explicit `U.Commitment` fields (`subject`, `modality`, `scope/window`, `referents`, and—when auditable—`adjudication`).

This pattern therefore treats **commitment** as the canonical Tech-level term and uses `U.Commitment` as the kernel object.

If your source material uses “binding” rhetoric (e.g., “binding contract”, “legally binding promise”), treat it as Plain-level phrasing that **MUST** be rewritten into explicit `U.Commitment` fields (`subject`, `modality`, `scope/window`, `referents`, and—when auditable—`adjudication`).
## Problem frame

FPF needs to express boundary governance and socio-technical obligations in a way that is:

* **role/agent-grounded** (someone is accountable),
* **scope-and-window explicit** (where/when the commitment holds),
* **reference-based** (no paraphrase drift; refer to claim IDs),
* **adjudicable** (if intended to be checkable, it has an evidence story).

In practice, texts use “MUST/SHALL/should”, “commits to”, “guarantees”, “SLA”, “contract”, etc. Without a stable kernel object for “the deontic binding”, authors either:

* assign agency to descriptions (“the API guarantees…”),
* smuggle admissibility gates into deontics (or vice versa),
* treat evidence as semantic truth,
* or create multiple inconsistent “contracts” across faces.

A.6.B provides routing discipline (L/A/D/E), and A.6.C provides contract-language unpacking, but both benefit from a **kernel-level** object that pins down what a `U.Commitment` is structurally (so “contract/binding” rhetoric does not leak back in as ontology).
## Problem

How can FPF represent a deontic commitment relation so that:

1. **The accountable subject is explicit** (role or role-enactor; not “the spec/interface/service”),
2. **Modality is explicit and lintable** (obligation / permission / prohibition / strength),
3. **Scope and validity window are explicit** (bounded context + time + conditions),
4. **The content is referenceable** via stable referent claim IDs (promise contents, gates, evidence targets, etc.),
5. **Adjudication hooks exist** when the binding is meant to be testable/auditable (links to evidence claims and carrier expectations),
6. **Conflicts can be represented** (without requiring this pattern to solve them).
## Forces

| Force                          | Tension                                                                                                                                             |

| Minimality                     | The object must be small enough to use routinely, not a full legal-contract model.                                                                  |

| Layering discipline            | It must not collapse “law / gate / duty / evidence”; it should enable routing rather than replace it.                                               |
| Local meaning                  | Defaults should be bounded-context local; cross-context bindings must be explicit.                                                                  |
| Auditability                   | Some commitments are aspirational; others are auditable. The representation must support both, without implying auditability by default.            |
| Multi-level governance reality | People/orgs/states can issue incompatible commitments; the model must represent issuer/authority/priority without “solving politics” inside Part A. |
## Solution

`U.Commitment` is the **kernel object** representing a **deontic commitment relation**: it links an accountable subject (role/role-enactor) to one or more referents via an explicit modality within an explicit scope/window, optionally with adjudication hooks.

This pattern defines:

* a **normative minimal structure** for `U.Commitment`,
* how `U.Commitment` relates to `U.PromiseContent`, `U.Work`, and evidence,
* how it is used as the canonical payload for **D-quadrant** claims (A.6.B),
* and what must be stated for a commitment to be considered **auditable**.

### Normative definition

A **`U.Commitment`** is a **governance object** representing a **deontic relation** that constrains an **accountable subject** (role or role-enactor) with respect to one or more **referents** under an explicit **modality** and explicit **scope/window**, optionally with explicit **adjudication hooks**.

Per A.7, a `U.Commitment` is **not** the text that states it: it is an object that is typically **instituted by** (and recorded via) one or more **speech acts and utterance descriptions** and may be carried by artifacts.
### Minimal structure (normative)

A conforming `U.Commitment` **SHALL** be representable by the following minimal record (field names are illustrative; the presence/meaning constraints are normative). **Required fields** are: `id`, `subject`, `modality`, `scope`, `validityWindow`, `referents`. `adjudication` and `source` are optional (but may become required by other patterns when auditability or authority must be made explicit).

```text
U.Commitment ::=
  {
    id: CommitmentId,                  // stable identifier; can align with D-* claim ID
    subject: CommitmentSubject,         // accountable role or role-enactor (not an episteme)
    owedTo: optional<set<CounterpartyRef>>, // who the commitment is owed to / intended beneficiary (optional; governance-facing, not required)
    modality: DeonticModalityToken,     // deontic modality (normalized; lintable)
    scope: U.ClaimScope,               // bounded context for applicability + non-temporal delimiters (same primitive as claim scopes; commitments are not epistemes)
    validityWindow: U.QualificationWindow, // Γ_time slice + conditions under which it applies / is in force
    referents: set<ReferentRef>,        // what is being bound (by reference, not paraphrase)
    adjudication: optional<AdjudicationHooks>, // evidence hooks if auditable
    source: optional<CommitmentSource>, // what instituted/authorized it (issuer + instituting act + utterance description), when provenance matters
    notes: optional<InformativeText>    // explicitly informative; not part of the binding
  }

CommitmentSubject ::=
  RoleRef | RoleAssignmentRef | PartyRef
  // At minimum: a RoleRef that denotes an accountable role kind in a bounded context.
  // If a concrete party/holder is known, prefer RoleAssignmentRef or PartyRef.
  // If multiple subjects are independently accountable, authors SHOULD model separate commitments (one per subject),
  // unless a joint obligation is explicitly modeled as a single PartyRef.

CounterpartyRef ::=
  PartyRef | RoleRef | RoleAssignmentRef
  // Optional “to whom”/beneficiary/counterparty handle. Keep minimal: do not treat it as a full legal-party model.

DeonticModalityToken ::=
  MUST | MUST_NOT | SHOULD | SHOULD_NOT | MAY
  // Interpreted as in RFC 8174 keyword discipline when used normatively.
  // **Normalization rule:** if authors use synonyms (e.g., SHALL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL),
  // they MUST be mapped to this normalized set for linting and comparison.
  //
  // **Normalization mapping (normative; illustrative table):**
  // - SHALL, REQUIRED        -> MUST
  // - SHALL NOT, PROHIBITED  -> MUST_NOT
  // - RECOMMENDED            -> SHOULD
  // - NOT RECOMMENDED        -> SHOULD_NOT
  // - OPTIONAL               -> MAY

ReferentRef ::=
  ClaimIdRef | PromiseContentRef | MethodDescriptionRef | WorkRef
  // Prefer ClaimIdRef when a routed claim ID exists (L-*, A-*, D-*, E-*).
  // Use PromiseContentRef when the commitment is about satisfying a promise-content clause (`U.PromiseContent`).
  // Use MethodDescriptionRef (preferred) when the commitment is about performing/avoiding a work-kind (work-to-be-done).
  // Use WorkRef only when the commitment is about an already executed/ongoing Work occurrence (rare).

PromiseContentRef ::=
  ObjectIdRef
  // MUST resolve to a `U.PromiseContent` object (A.2.3). (Some chapters may call this a “promise content”.)

AdjudicationHooks ::=
  {
    evidenceRefs: set<ClaimIdRef>,      // typically E-* claim IDs
    carrierRefs: optional<set<CarrierClassRef>>,  // if evidence carriers are part of the hook
    evaluationNotes: optional<InformativeText>    // how adjudication is done; informative unless normed elsewhere
  }

DescriptionRef ::=
  ClaimIdRef | EpistemeRef
  // A pointer to an utterance description that states/records the commitment (e.g., spec clause, policy text).

SpeechActRef ::=
  ObjectIdRef
  // MUST resolve to a `U.SpeechAct` Work occurrence (A.2.9).

CommitmentSource ::=
  {
    issuer: optional<PartyRef>,         // who issued/authorized the commitment (can be distinct from subject)
    speechActRef: optional<SpeechActRef>, // instituting communicative act, when available
    descriptionRef: optional<DescriptionRef>, // where it is stated/recorded (utterance description)
    authorityClass: optional<AuthorityTag>, // e.g., policy, contract, statute, standard (informative tag)
    precedence: optional<PriorityTag>   // used for conflict handling elsewhere; not a truth claim
  }
```

**Normative constraints:**

* **(C1) Subject must be accountable.** `subject` **MUST** resolve to an accountable role/party; it **MUST NOT** be “the interface/spec/service/system” as an episteme.
* **(C2) Modality must be explicit and normalized.** `modality` **MUST** be present for normative commitments and **MUST** be normalized to `DeonticModalityToken`.
* **(C3) Scope + validity must be explicit.** `scope` and `validityWindow` **MUST** be present. Defaults are allowed only when an explicit context policy is cited as the source of those defaults (do not rely on “implied defaults”). `validityWindow` expresses *in-force* conditions; per-action admissibility gates belong in referenced `A-*` predicates.
* **(C4) Referents must be non-empty.** `referents` **MUST** contain at least one referent (what is being obligated/permitted/prohibited).
* **(C5) Referents must be by reference when possible.** If the bound content already exists as claim IDs, `referents` **SHOULD** cite those IDs rather than restating them.
* **(C6) Auditable commitments must have adjudication hooks.** If a commitment is intended to be audited/adjudicated by observation, `adjudication.evidenceRefs` **SHALL** include the evidence claim IDs (typically `E-*`) that carry the adjudication substrate.
* **(C7) Evidence belongs in adjudication by default.** If an `E-*` claim is referenced **only** to define *how to measure/verify* a commitment, it **SHALL** be listed in `adjudication.evidenceRefs` (not in `referents`). An `E-*` claim **MAY** appear in `referents` only when the commitment’s content is itself an evidence-producing/retaining duty (e.g., “MUST retain traces”).
* **(C8) Default auditability stance is explicit.** If `adjudication` is absent, the commitment SHALL be treated as **non-auditable by default** (aspirational / governance-only), unless another pattern or Context policy explicitly supplies adjudication hooks by reference.
### Interaction rules (normative)

1. **`U.PromiseContent` is promise content; `U.Commitment` is the governance relation.**
   A service promise clause (what is promised) is not, by itself, an accountable commitment. A `U.Commitment` makes an accountable subject responsible for providing/satisfying the service promise (or for satisfying other governance clauses).


2. **`U.Commitment` is not `U.Work`.**
   Work is execution; commitment is governance. A commitment may reference evidence targets, but it does not “contain” evidence.

3. **Commitments may reference admissibility predicates; they must not become predicates.**
   If compliance requires satisfying a gate predicate, the commitment should reference the gate (`A-*`) as a referent, rather than rewriting the predicate as prose inside the commitment.

4. **A `U.Commitment` is a governance object, not a law.**
   Commitments are not truth-conditional invariants. If something is intended to be an invariant, it belongs as law/definition (L), and a commitment can reference it.

5. **Lifecycle changes are explicit (no silent mutation).**
   When a commitment is updated, narrowed, broadened, superseded, or revoked, the change **SHOULD** be represented as a new `U.Commitment` (new ID) and an instituting `U.SpeechAct` (A.2.9) that references the affected commitment IDs (e.g., via `U.Commitment.source.speechActRef` and a status/supersession claim), rather than editing a published commitment in place without an auditable change record.
### Canonical use in boundary claim registers (recommended)

When using the A.6 stack, represent each **D-quadrant** atomic claim as a `U.Commitment` payload with:

* `id = D-*`,
* `subject = accountable role/party`,
* `modality = DeonticModalityToken` (normalized from RFC-keyword family usage),
* `referents = {PromiseContentRef, MethodDescriptionRef, L-*, A-* … as needed}` (content/targets),
* `adjudication.evidenceRefs = {E-* …}` when the commitment is meant to be checkable.
## Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)

### Tell (universal rule)

A deontic statement becomes stable and reviewable when it is represented as a `U.Commitment` with an accountable subject, an explicit modality, explicit scope/window, referent claim IDs, and—if auditable—explicit evidence hooks.
### Show #1 (system archetype: incident response SLO discipline, post‑2015 SRE practice)

A production org states: “Severity‑1 incidents must be responded to within 4 hours.”

A routable commitment:

* `subject`: `RoleAssignmentRef(OpsTeam as ProviderRole)` (or at least `RoleRef(ProviderRole)`),
* `modality`: `MUST`,
* `scope`: bounded context `IncidentManagement`,
* `validityWindow`: `calendarYear2026` (or “while contract edition X is active”),
* `referents`: `{PromiseContentRef(SVC-SLO-RESP-4H), A-SEV1-CLASS-1}`
   where `A-SEV1-CLASS-1` is the admissibility predicate for “counts as Sev‑1”.
* `adjudication.evidenceRefs`: `{E-SLO-RESP-1}`
   where `E-SLO-RESP-1` defines the measurement substrate and evidence carriers (tickets + timestamps + clock source).

This makes the statement auditable by construction and keeps “classification gate” separate from “duty”.
### Show #2 (episteme archetype: protocol specification with behavioural typing motif)

A protocol spec states: “Participants MUST follow the state machine; violations are rejected; traces are retained for audit.”

Model as:

* A set of `L-*` claims defining the state machine and safety/progress properties within the model,
* `A-*` claims defining what runtime checks count as “admissible trace”,
* `D-*` commitments instantiated as `U.Commitment` with:

  * `subject = RoleRef(ParticipantImplementer)`
  * `modality = MUST`
  * `referents = {L-STATE-MACHINE-1, A-TRACE-VALID-1, MethodDescriptionRef(TraceRetentionProcedure_v1)}`
  * `adjudication.evidenceRefs = {E-TRACE-LOG-1}`

This mirrors common post‑2015 “protocols as types” practice: semantics and progress live in the model; compliance is agent governance; evidence is trace-based.
## Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Kernel universal** (any place FPF needs deontic binding).

* **Gov bias:** prioritizes accountable subjects and adjudication hooks; may increase authoring overhead.
* **Arch bias:** pushes reference-by-ID and explicit scope/window to preserve evolvability and reduce drift.
* **Onto/Epist bias:** enforces “descriptions don’t promise”; commitments bind agents/roles.
* **Prag bias:** aligns with common spec-language practice (RFC keywords) but makes the structure explicit.
* **Did bias:** favors a small record that can be taught and linted.
## Conformance Checklist (normative)

1. **CC‑A.2.8‑1 (Accountable subject).** A normative `U.Commitment` **MUST** name an accountable `subject` (role/role-enactor/party) and **MUST NOT** use an episteme (spec/interface/document) as subject.

2. **CC‑A.2.8‑2 (Explicit modality).** A normative `U.Commitment` **MUST** specify `modality` as `DeonticModalityToken` (with any RFC-keyword synonyms normalized to it).

3. **CC‑A.2.8‑3 (Scope & validity explicit).** A normative `U.Commitment` **MUST** specify `scope` (`U.ClaimScope`) and `validityWindow` (`U.QualificationWindow`), or explicitly cite the context policy that supplies defaults (do not rely on “implied defaults”).

4. **CC‑A.2.8‑4 (Referents present and by ID).** `referents` **MUST** be non‑empty. If the bound content exists as claim IDs, the commitment **SHOULD** reference those IDs in `referents` rather than restating their content.

5. **CC‑A.2.8‑5 (Auditable commitments have hooks).** If the commitment is intended to be auditable, it **SHALL** include `adjudication.evidenceRefs` referencing the evidence claims (typically `E-*`) that make adjudication possible.
6. **CC‑A.2.8‑6 (Evidence separation).** If an `E-*` claim is referenced only for measurement/verification, it **SHALL** appear in `adjudication.evidenceRefs` (not in `referents`).
## Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern                                        | Why it fails                                               | Repair                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Episteme-as-subject** (“the API SHALL…”)          | assigns agency to descriptions                             | use an accountable role/party as `subject`; keep the spec as `source.descriptionRef`  |
| **Missing scope/window**                            | commitments become unreviewable (“always/never” ambiguity) | declare `scope` + `validityWindow`; if global, say so explicitly via a policy/default |
| **Paraphrase drift**                                | drift across faces and docs                                | reference via `referents` using claim IDs; avoid restating the same constraint        |
| **Auditable rhetoric** (“guaranteed”) without hooks | not adjudicable                                            | add `adjudication.evidenceRefs` pointing to `E-*` claims and carrier expectations     |
| **Gate-as-duty**                                    | confuses admissibility with obligation                     | put predicate in `A-*`; make commitment reference it (`D→A`)                          |
## Consequences

**Benefits**

* Makes deontic statements **first-class and lintable** (subject/modality/scope/referents/hooks).
* Enables clean integration with boundary routing (A.6.B) and contract unpacking (A.6.C) without embedding ontology in naming patterns.
* Improves auditability by making evidence expectations explicit *only when intended*.

**Trade-offs / mitigations**

* Adds structure to authoring; mitigated by allowing conceptual evidence hooks and default scope policies.
* Does not resolve conflicts between commitments; mitigated by capturing `source/precedence` tags and delegating resolution to governance patterns (Part D) and context policy.
## Rationale

The triad “promise / utterance / commitment” is useful for language discipline, but deontic ontology should not be anchored in a naming-focused pattern. A kernel object:

* stabilizes what a “commitment” structurally is,
* ensures “MUST/SHALL” talk is representable without category mistakes,
* and provides the missing bridge between governance claims and adjudication (via explicit hooks), which is essential for boundary engineering and for later ethics/governance work.
## SoTA-Echoing (informative; post‑2015 alignment)

> **Informative.** Alignment notes; not normative requirements.

* **BCP 14 (RFC 2119 + RFC 8174) / modern spec-language discipline (2017+).** Treating modality tokens as a controlled family is standard; `U.Commitment.modality` makes this family explicit and lintable.
* **Policy-as-code ecosystems (2016+).** Modern governance stacks often encode gates as code (e.g., Kubernetes admission controls, OPA/Rego-style policy evaluation) and obligations as process controls; the `U.Commitment` structure helps keep “gate predicates” separate from “actor duties”, while still linking them by reference.
* **ODRL-style duty/permission/prohibition modeling (W3C ODRL 2.2, 2018).** The minimal “subject + modality + constraint/window + target” shape is widely used; `U.Commitment` adopts the kernel of that idea while keeping FPF’s boundary routing and evidence discipline.
* **Trace-based compliance and audit (2018+ supply-chain / reproducibility practice).** “Compliance is evidenced by artifacts” is mainstream; `adjudication.evidenceRefs` captures this without turning evidence into semantics.
* **Supply-chain attestations (2021+).** Attestation-oriented schemes (e.g., SLSA-style provenance, transparency logs) operationalize “claims + evidence carriers”; `adjudication.evidenceRefs` is the bridge point without collapsing evidence into truth.
## Relations

**Uses / builds on**

* A.2.1 for identifying accountable roles vs role-enactors (role assignments).
* A.2.6 for expressing scope and time/window (`U.ClaimScope`, `U.QualificationWindow`).
* A.7 for keeping “binding” distinct from “utterance” and from “carriers”.

**Used by**

* A.6.B (Quadrant D) as the canonical payload shape for deontic statements.
* A.6.C (Contract Unpacking) as the formal anchor for the “Commitment” component of the bundle.
* Part D governance/ethics patterns (future work) for expressing layered, conflicting, multi-authority commitments.

**Coordinates with**

* A.2.3 (`U.PromiseContent`): services are promise clauses; commitments bind accountable subjects to those clauses.
* **A.2.9 (`U.SpeechAct`)**: `U.Commitment.source.speechActRef` points to the instituting communicative work occurrence when provenance matters.
* A.15.1 (`U.Work`) and evidence patterns: adjudication hooks refer to evidence in work, not to text.
