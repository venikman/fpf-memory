# Wholeness Language Unpacking (RPR-WHOLE)
> Pattern `A.6.H` · Stable · Architectural (A) · Normative
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

**Plain-name.** Wholeness / integrity / part / boundary disambiguation
**One-liner.** Treat “whole/part/complete/holistic” as *trigger words* that force an explicit choice among **reference level (referent vs description vs work)**, **boundary**, **parthood kind**, **aggregation (Γ)**, **order/time**, and **completeness (capability/spec/evidence)**.

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative

**Placement.** A.6 precision-restoration cluster; a lexical front-end to mereology and Γ selection.
**Specialises.** A.6.P Relational Precision Restoration Suite. 
**Works alongside.** A.14 (mereology extension), B.1.1 (edge selection), B.1.4 (Γ_ctx/Γ_time), A.15 (role–method–work).
**Template discipline.** Canonical section order and headings follow E.8.

Teams routinely use compact natural-language tokens like *whole*, *part*, *integrity*, *holistic*, and *complete* to gesture at multiple different things at once: a boundary, a bill-of-materials, a collective, a workflow, a lifecycle, or “end-to-end” capability. The same sentence then gets interpreted as **structure**, **procedure**, **history**, or **competence**, and the disagreement is not resolvable because the referent is under-specified.

## Content

## Problem frame

Teams routinely use compact natural-language tokens like *whole*, *part*, *integrity*, *holistic*, and *complete* to gesture at multiple different things at once: a boundary, a bill-of-materials, a collective, a workflow, a lifecycle, or “end-to-end” capability. The same sentence then gets interpreted as **structure**, **procedure**, **history**, or **competence**, and the disagreement is not resolvable because the referent is under-specified.

This matters because FPF’s core moves are boundary-grounded wholes (holons) and explicit composition operators (Γ). A holon is individuated by a **boundary that separates inside from environment**, with interactions crossing that boundary.  When language collapses “whole” into a rhetorical flourish, the modeler is tempted to smuggle order, time, membership, or capability into part–whole edges, causing the classic category errors that later break Γ composition and audits.

This pattern is a practical repair protocol: it does not fight natural language; it **treats its vague words as triggers** that force an explicit unpacking into the minimal, typed vocabulary for wholeness claims.
## Problem

Without an unpacking discipline, the following failure modes recur:

1. **Boundary ambiguity.** “The whole system” is asserted with no statement of what is inside vs outside, so “environment” and “interface” debates become circular.
2. **Parthood overload.** “Part of” is used for physical parts, logical subsections, group membership, fractions of a stock, and lifecycle stages—then encoded as one generic inclusion.
3. **Order-as-part.** Teams say “Step B is part of the process” and model it as a structural inclusion, reproducing the structure-as-sequence anti-pattern. 
4. **History-as-part.** Versions or phases are treated as subcomponents instead of time-slices of the same carrier, erasing coverage/overlap constraints.
5. **Completeness conflation.** “Complete/turnkey/end-to-end” is treated as “has all parts,” when the intent was capability coverage, specification coverage, or evidence coverage (role–method–work confusion).
6. **Discipline/context drift.** “Chemistry as a whole” alternates between meaning a method family, a social community, and a bounded context—leading to incompatible nesting stories.
7. **Integrity misrouting.** “Integrity” is read as “wholeness/coherence” when the author meant **security/data integrity** (CIA-style integrity, constraint satisfaction, tamper-resistance), producing the wrong facet unpacking and the wrong remediation.
8. **Artefact–referent collapse.** “The whole system is documented” / “the whole model is deployed” slides between a system and its description artefact, so inclusion edges and completeness claims get attached to the wrong level (A.15: referent vs description vs work/evidence).

The result is not merely imprecise prose; it is **non-auditable modeling**, because different readers (or validators) infer different decomposition rules.
## Forces

| Force                                                        | Tension                                                                                                      |

| **Conversational economy vs. auditability**                  | One short word (“whole”) ↔ a reviewable statement of boundary, part-kinds, and composition rule.             |
| **Cross-domain portability vs. local idiom**                 | Domain jargon (“module”, “pipeline”, “discipline”) ↔ stable typed distinctions that travel between contexts. |
| **Structural clarity vs. procedural realism**                | “Parts of X” feels intuitive for workflows ↔ order and time have different semantics than mereology.         |
| **Wholeness as individuation vs. wholeness as completeness** | “A whole thing” can mean “one bounded entity” ↔ “covers everything we care about.”                           |
| **Parsimony vs. expressivity**                               | Too many relation kinds overwhelm ↔ too few makes “part-of” a semantic dumping ground.                       |
## Solution

This pattern applies the A.6.P repair recipe to the **wholeness polysemy cluster** by introducing a stable lens, a trigger list, a facet vocabulary, and an always-unpack rewrite discipline.

### A.6.P crosswalk (what this pattern adds)

This is a wholeness-specific binding of the generic A.6.P repair sequence:

1. **Detect.** WHOL triggers mark a sentence as semantically overloaded.
2. **Expand.** Enumerate candidate meanings along the facets (boundary, parthood, fold/Γ, order/time, completeness).
3. **Discriminate.** Apply the table tests (level-of-reference, transitivity, swap-test, carrier-identity test, coverage test) to eliminate candidates.
4. **Rewrite.** Replace the trigger token with facet headphrases + typed relations.
5. **Lock-in.** Record the choice (optionally via a wholenessSituation record) so the document stops re-litigating the same ambiguity.
### Lens: Boundary–Parthood–Fold–Order/Time–Completeness

When any of the trigger words below appear on a **load-bearing surface**, interpret the sentence through this ordered checklist and rewrite until the claim is decidable *for the current purpose* (i.e., the remaining ambiguity would not change the model edge(s), Γ choice, or review decision). Multiple facets may legitimately apply; “stop” only when the residual facets are irrelevant to the claim being made.

```text
Definition WHOL-LBS-1 (load-bearing surface).
A sentence is on a load-bearing surface if it functions as a requirement ("SHALL"/"MUST"),
an invariant, an interface/boundary claim, a model edge/label, a decision record, a test oracle,
or any statement that downstream reasoning or audits depend on.
```

0. **Term-of-art override.** Is the trigger part of a defined term-of-art (glossary entry, standard term, contract term)? If yes, cite that definition and do not force WHOL facet unpacking unless the definition itself contains unresolved WHOL triggers.
   *Clarification:* this override applies to the *term itself*. Still unpack any separate wholeness claim the sentence makes *about* the term (e.g., boundary, composition, or coverage).
0.5 **Reference level.** Is the sentence about (i) a holon-level referent, (ii) a description artefact (spec/model/document), or (iii) an executed run/work/evidence? State the level explicitly when it affects relation choice (e.g., ConstituentOf for document structure vs StepOf/SerialStepOf for the procedure itself).
1. **Boundary.** If the claim is holon-level: what is the *inside* and what is the *environment* (boundary-based individuation)? Name at least one cross-boundary interaction, interface, dependency, or external constraint relevant to the claim. If there are multiple plausible boundaries (levels/resolutions), list candidates and state which boundary this claim is about.
2. **Parthood kind.** If “part-of” is intended, which kind is meant: **ComponentOf, ConstituentOf, PortionOf**, or **MemberOf** (collection membership)? If the claim is about a description artefact, default to **ConstituentOf** and keep the referent explicit (model-of vs modeled).
3. **Fold.** If the sentence asserts a whole-level property that depends on how parts are “glued” (not merely listed), what composition operator (Γ flavour) is implied: structure, episteme, context, time/history, method, or work/cost?
4. **Order/time routing.** Is the claim about a procedure graph (**StepOf** + order/concurrency constraints such as **SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf**), or about **temporal continuity/coverage** (**PhaseOf** aggregated via Γ_time), rather than structural containment? If the claim is about *observed* concurrency in a specific run, route it to work/evidence (A.15) rather than treating it as ParallelFactorOf.
5. **Completeness.** Is “whole/complete/end-to-end” actually about **completeness in a scope**: capability coverage, specification coverage, and/or evidence coverage (A.15 layer), rather than “has all parts”?

A “wholeness” statement is considered precise only after the sentence has been rewritten to answer the subset of these questions that actually matters.
### Trigger words and phrases

Treat the following as **WHOL triggers** on normative surfaces and in Working-Model claims.

**Hard triggers (always unpack on load-bearing surfaces):**

* **Whole / entire / as a whole / integrated / unified / coherent**
* **Part / piece / component / module / element / subsystem**
* **Includes / consists of / composed of / contains / comprises**
* **Complete / end-to-end / turnkey / fully specified / self-contained**
* **Integrity** (always classify first; see CC-A6H-10)

**Conditional triggers (unpack when coupled to a wholeness frame such as “as a whole”, “part of”, “composed of”, “end-to-end”, “integrated”, or “complete”):**

* **Pipeline / workflow / process / step / stage**
* **Phase / version / revision / lifecycle**
* **Collection / group / team / set of**

**Soft triggers (unpack only when used as a wholeness predicate, not as a term-of-art):**

* **Holistic / holonic**
* **Context / environment** (when asserted “as a whole” or treated as a bounded entity)

**Term-of-art override.** If a trigger occurs inside a defined term-of-art (e.g., “data integrity”, “integrity constraint”, “referential integrity”), cite the glossary definition and do not force WHOL unpacking unless that definition itself contains unresolved WHOL triggers.

In running prose you can still say “whole” informally, but on load-bearing surfaces these words are treated as a lintable signal: “this sentence needs a facet rewrite.”
### Canonical facet headphrases

Use these headphrases to replace the ambiguous word with the intended semantics:

**A) Boundary & environment**

* “the holon boundary of X is …”
* “the environment of X includes …”
* “interaction across X’s boundary is …” (not parthood)

**B) Parthood kinds**

* “A is ComponentOf B” for physical assembly
* “A is ConstituentOf B” for conceptual/content inclusion
* “A is PortionOf B with μ=…” for a quantitative fraction
* “A is MemberOf C” for membership in a collective (not a part–whole chain)

**C) Order/time**

* “A is PhaseOf carrier B over window τ” for a lifecycle slice of the same carrier (temporal continuity/coverage; not inside/outside containment)
* “Step s is StepOf procedure P” for step membership in a procedure graph (not a part–whole claim)
* “Step i is SerialStepOf Step j” for precedence constraints in order-sensitive procedures (directed; read as “i precedes j”, not as containment; use an adjacency variant if you need “immediately before”)
* “Step u is ParallelFactorOf Step v” for parallelizability/concurrency potential (often symmetric; state synchronization/independence/resource constraints)
* “In run r, Step u ExecutedConcurrentlyWith Step v” for observed concurrency in a specific work/evidence instance (A.15); do not infer this from ParallelFactorOf alone

**Semantics cues (review-time, minimal invariants).**

* **ComponentOf**: typically transitive within a bill-of-materials; removing A changes the assembled carrier; do not use for sequences or memberships.
* **ConstituentOf**: transitive within an information/conceptual artefact; supports “section/chapter/lemma is part of paper/proof” without implying physical assembly.
* **PortionOf**: requires an explicit extensive measure μ and an additivity story (non-overlap + sum); avoid if you cannot state μ.
* **MemberOf**: not transitive; does not imply the collective is an assembly; membership can change without “recomposition”.
* **PhaseOf**: same carrier across time; requires an explicit window τ and a coverage/overlap story; aggregate with Γ_time when composing the history narrative.
* **StepOf**: membership of a step node in a procedure graph; does not imply physical assembly or conceptual containment. Pair with precedence/concurrency constraints rather than “part-of”.
* **SerialStepOf**: directed precedence constraint on step nodes (read as “i precedes j”). For a single execution trace/iteration, the precedence constraint set should be acyclic (strict partial order). If the procedure includes iteration/loops, model the loop explicitly (e.g., as a loop/control-flow construct or by time-indexing step instances) rather than introducing cycles into SerialStepOf. If you mean “adjacent in sequence”, use an explicit adjacency form.
* **ParallelFactorOf**: parallelizability constraint between step nodes under stated assumptions (resources, independence, synchronization). Treat it as *potential* parallelism (a property of the procedure design), not as evidence that two steps were executed concurrently. If you need to record observed concurrency, use a run-anchored work/evidence relation (e.g., ExecutedConcurrentlyWith in run r). ParallelFactorOf is typically symmetric and not transitive; say so if you rely on those properties.

**D) Fold / aggregation**

* “Γ_sys / Γ_epist / Γ_ctx / Γ_time / Γ_method / Γ_work” as the explicit “gluing rule” (the operator that produces the composite)

**E) Completeness**

* “capability coverage is …”
* “specification coverage is …”
* “evidence coverage is …”
  with explicit scope (G) if relevant.
### Optional bundling record: wholenessSituation

This is a didactic bundling device for prose and review; it adds no new kernel semantics (the semantics remain in boundary + relation kinds + Γ choices). 

```text
Definition WHOL-REC-1 (wholenessSituation record).
wholenessSituation ::= ⟨
  wholeRef,
  referenceLevel ∈ {referent, description, work},
  boundaryRefs (0..*),
  environmentRefs (0..*),
  carrierRef (0..1),       // required if PhaseOf is asserted
  parthoodKinds ⊆ {ComponentOf, ConstituentOf, PortionOf, MemberOf},
  measureRef (0..1),       // μ if PortionOf is asserted
  foldRef (0..1),          // Γ_* if a fold is asserted
  orderTimeKinds ⊆ {StepOf, SerialStepOf, ParallelFactorOf, PhaseOf},
  orderTimeRef (0..1),     // the step graph / timeline segment being referenced
  completenessKinds ⊆ {capability, spec, evidence},
  scopeRef (0..1)          // ClaimScope (G) if relevant
⟩

Note: if the trigger token is “integrity” and the intent is security/data integrity (CIA integrity, constraint satisfaction), do not treat it as a WHOL situation; route it as an integrity-as-quality statement instead of forcing boundary/parthood semantics.
```

Use it when a document keeps repeating “the whole X”; a single record makes the intended wholeness facets stable across pages.
### Always-unpack rule for normative surfaces

**D-WHOL-UNPACK.** In any normative or Working-Model sentence, if a WHOL trigger appears, the author SHALL rewrite the sentence using facet headphrases and typed relations, or attach a Candidate-Set Note while the choice remains open.

This keeps “whole/part” as natural-language scaffolding while preventing it from becoming semantic authority.

```text
Definition WHOL-CSN-1 (Candidate-Set Note).
CandidateSetNote ::= ⟨
  triggerToken,
  excerptRef,
  candidates,              // explicit candidate meanings (facet combinations)
  discriminatorsPending,   // questions/tests to run before committing
  noSmugglingConstraints   // what must NOT be asserted while open (e.g., “do not encode as generic PartOf”)
⟩
```

A Candidate-Set Note is conformant only if it explicitly blocks semantic smuggling (e.g., forbids encoding an unresolved “part-of” as a generic inclusion edge).
### Disambiguation guide

Use the following format when reviewing or rewriting: trigger → candidates → discriminating questions/tests → canonical rewrite → routing hooks. 

**Minimal discriminator kit (lintable tests).**

* **Level-of-reference test:** Is the sentence about the referent holon, a description artefact (spec/model/document), or a work/evidence instance? If the level changes the edge type, make it explicit before choosing relations.
* **Boundary test:** Can you point to an inside/outside cut and name at least one cross-boundary interaction, interface, dependency, or external constraint that matters for this claim? If not, either “whole” is rhetorical, or the boundary is intentionally out of scope (say so), or you are not making a holon-level claim (see level-of-reference).
* **Transitivity test (parthood):** Would “A part-of B” and “B part-of C” normally license “A part-of C” under the intended meaning? If yes, you likely mean a typed parthood (ComponentOf/ConstituentOf). If no, suspect MemberOf, PortionOf, or an order/time relation.
* **Swap test (order):** If you swap A and B, does the meaning change? If yes, encode precedence/concurrency, not containment.
* **Carrier-identity test (history):** Is it the *same carrier* across time with windows/coverage constraints? If yes, PhaseOf + Γ_time. If not, model a transformation that yields a new holon identity.
* **Coverage test (completeness):** “Complete” with respect to what scope (G), and is it capability/spec/evidence coverage (A.15) rather than “has all parts”?

**Candidate-Set Note.** If you cannot yet decide which candidate meaning is intended, record a Candidate-Set Note and proceed without silently collapsing meanings.
### Change lexicon for wholeness narratives

When “the whole” evolves, narrate the change as an explicit change-class, not as “it’s still the same whole” rhetoric:

* **reboundary**: boundary/interface changed (inside/outside changed)
* **recompose**: a parthood edge was added/removed or its kind changed (ComponentOf ↔ ConstituentOf, etc.)
* **repartition**: PortionOf distribution changed (with explicit μ)
* **rephase**: PhaseOf windows changed (coverage/overlap story)
* **reorder / reparallelize**: SerialStepOf / ParallelFactorOf graph changed
* **redescribe**: the claim’s reference level shifted (system ↔ description ↔ work/evidence) while retaining the same noun phrase (“the whole X”)
* **recomplete**: capability/spec/evidence coverage changed (scope pin updated)

If the identity criterion fails (it is no longer “the same carrier”), escalate: do not hide it behind “whole/integrity” language.
### Guardrails

1. **No “part-of” as a universal relation.** “Part of” is a prompt to choose a typed relation, not a final answer. 
2. **No order/time smuggling.** Steps and histories must not be encoded as structural inclusion.
3. **No membership upgrade.** A set of members is not automatically a composed artefact; keep MemberOf distinct from ComponentOf. 
4. **No role-as-part.** Role boundaries are scope and authorization boundaries, not BoM structure.
5. **Cross-boundary influence is interaction.** If something crosses a boundary, it is an interaction/interface story, not a parthood story.
6. **No integrity-as-wholeness by default.** If “integrity” appears, first classify it as (a) wholeness/coherence, or (b) security/data integrity quality (CIA/constraints). Route accordingly before invoking parthood or Γ.
7. **No artefact–referent drift.** Do not slide between a system, its description artefacts, and observed runs under the same “whole X” phrase; state the reference level and use the appropriate relations (ConstituentOf vs ComponentOf vs work/evidence predicates).
## Archetypal Grounding

**Tell.** “Wholeness” is not one concept in practice; it is a shorthand for boundary, composition rule, and coverage. Precision comes from unpacking the shorthand into the smallest set of explicit claims that make disagreements decidable.

**Show — System vignette (lab automation).**
A team says: “The whole chromatography pipeline is turnkey, and the chemist owns the whole thing.” This collapses three meanings: workflow order, capability completeness, and role boundary. A precise rewrite becomes:

* “Pipeline” is a **MethodDescription** with steps connected by **SerialStepOf**; the composite procedure is aggregated by **Γ_method / Γ_ctx**.
* “Turnkey” is **capability/spec coverage**: which required roles/capabilities cover which steps under which scope (G).
* “Chemist owns” is a **role assignment boundary** inside a bounded context (who is authorized/required), not a ComponentOf structure.

Now the discussion can separate: “Is the workflow correct?” vs “Do we have capability coverage?” vs “Who is responsible in this context?”

**Show — Episteme vignette (paper + proof + revision).**
A reviewer writes: “Section 3 is part of the proof, and v2 is part of v1.” Both “part” usages differ.

* “Section 3” is typically **ConstituentOf** the paper (content inclusion), while “step 3 of the proof” is **SerialStepOf** in the proof’s reasoning order.
* “v2 part of v1” is usually **PhaseOf** the same carrier across time, aggregated by **Γ_time**—unless the identity changed, in which case it is a new artefact produced by an explicit transformation.

The author can now fix the prose and the model without guessing what “part” meant.
## Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal**.

* **Gov bias.** Prefers auditable, reviewable claims over rhetorically satisfying language; mitigated by allowing Candidate-Set Notes when decisions are intentionally deferred. 
* **Arch bias.** Prefers small, typed vocabularies and explicit operator selection (Γ flavours), which can feel “heavy” in early drafts; mitigated by “always-unpack only on load-bearing surfaces.”
* **Onto/Epist bias.** Privileges clear category boundaries (structure vs order vs history vs capability); mitigated by permitting multiple facets when the situation genuinely requires them.
* **Prag bias.** Optimizes for fewer downstream refactors by forcing early disambiguation; mitigated by the change lexicon, which makes late changes explicit and safe.
* **Did bias.** Prefers teachability and lintable triggers; mitigated by keeping the facet set small and using domain-native examples.
## Conformance Checklist

| ID                                         | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Purpose                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CC-A6H-1 (Trigger discipline).**         | Authors of normative or Working-Model text SHALL treat WHOL triggers as disambiguation triggers and apply the facet rewrite or attach a Candidate-Set Note.                                                                  | Prevents “whole/part” from becoming semantic authority.          |
| **CC-A6H-2 (Typed parthood).**             | When “part-of/contains/composed-of” is meant as inclusion, authors SHALL choose a typed relation kind consistent with the edge selection guide (ComponentOf / ConstituentOf / PortionOf; MemberOf if collective). If the prose is actually asserting temporal slicing/versioning, authors SHALL use PhaseOf + Γ_time and SHALL NOT encode it as inclusion. | Eliminates universal “part-of” dumping.                          |
| **CC-A6H-3 (No order/time in mereology).** | Authors SHALL NOT express step order, concurrency, or temporal coverage as structural inclusion; they SHALL use ordered relations and Γ_ctx/Γ_method or PhaseOf and Γ_time.                                                  | Blocks the structure-as-sequence and history-as-structure traps. |
|                                            | *Note:* ConstituentOf is allowed when the claim is about the *description artefact* (e.g., step descriptions inside a method document); StepOf/SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf are for the procedure graph itself.            |                                                                         |
| **CC-A6H-4 (Membership separation).**      | Authors SHALL keep MemberOf claims distinct from ComponentOf/ConstituentOf and SHALL NOT infer composition from membership without an explicit construction claim.                                                           | Prevents accidental upgrade from set to assembly.                |
| **CC-A6H-5 (Completeness routing).**       | When “complete/end-to-end/turnkey” is used, authors SHALL state whether the claim is about capability coverage, specification coverage, or evidence coverage, and route terms to A.15 vocabulary.                            | Prevents wholeness-as-rhetoric in method/role discourse.         |
| **CC-A6H-6 (Boundary clarity).**           | If “whole/integrity/environment” is asserted at holon-level, authors SHALL name the relevant boundary and at least one interface/interaction/dependency/constraint concern, or explicitly state that boundary is out of scope for the claim. | Makes inside/outside explicit and reviewable.                    |
| **CC-A6H-7 (Change-class narration).**     | When a wholeness story changes across editions, authors SHOULD use the change lexicon (reboundary/recompose/rephase/reorder/recomplete) rather than reusing “whole” rhetoric.                                                | Keeps evolution auditable.                                       |
| **CC-A6H-8 (Review lint).**                | Reviewers and validators SHOULD flag un-unpacked WHOL triggers on normative surfaces as nonconformant, unless an explicit Candidate-Set Note exists.                                                                         | Makes the discipline enforceable at low cost.                    |
| **CC-A6H-9 (Term-of-art override).**       | If a WHOL trigger appears inside a defined term-of-art, authors SHALL cite or inline the definition and SHALL NOT treat the occurrence as a WHOL trigger unless the definition itself contains unresolved WHOL triggers.       | Prevents linter noise and misrouting.                            |
| **CC-A6H-10 (Integrity classification).**  | When “integrity” appears, authors SHALL explicitly classify it as (a) wholeness/coherence, (b) security/data integrity quality, or (c) another defined term-of-art, and route the rewrite accordingly.                      | Avoids integrity-as-wholeness category errors.                    |
| **CC-A6H-11 (Reference level).**           | On normative or Working-Model surfaces, authors SHALL state whether a wholeness claim is about the referent holon, a description artefact (spec/model/document), or a work/evidence instance whenever that distinction affects relation choice, completeness meaning, or validation. | Prevents artefact–referent drift and A.15 level errors.          |
## Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern                 | Symptom                                                                | Why it fails (force violated)                                        | How to avoid / repair                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Holistic-as-evasion**      | “We took a holistic view” replaces boundary/scope detail               | Sacrifices auditability for conversational economy                   | State the boundary, environment, and scope (G); use wholeness facets explicitly                   |
| **Universal part-of**        | Everything is “part of” everything                                     | Breaks portability; different readers infer different relations      | Replace with ComponentOf/ConstituentOf/PortionOf/PhaseOf/MemberOf                                 |
| **Structure-as-sequence**    | Step order encoded as containment                                      | Collapses procedure into structure; causes Γ errors                  | Use SerialStepOf/ParallelFactorOf + Γ_ctx/Γ_method                                                |
| **History-as-structure**     | Versions modeled as parts                                              | Erases temporal coverage and identity discipline                     | Use PhaseOf + Γ_time; if identity changed, model a new artefact                                   |
| **Collection-as-assembly**   | A team “consists of” people encoded as ComponentOf                     | Confuses membership with assembly                                    | Use MemberOf and, if the group acts, model it as a bounded system with its own work               |
| **Completeness-by-rhetoric** | “Method is complete” without stating what it covers                    | Confuses structural wholeness with capability/spec/evidence coverage | Rewrite using A.15: MethodDescription vs Method vs Work, plus explicit coverage                   |
| **Module vs component blur** | “Module” used sometimes as physical part, sometimes as deployment unit | Breaks cross-team comparability                                      | Use a mini-definition on first mention and route: component vs constituent vs deployment artefact |
| **Artefact–referent drift**   | “The whole X” alternates between a system and its spec/model/document   | Breaks auditability; smuggles relations across A.15 levels            | State the reference level explicitly; use ConstituentOf for document parts; keep model-of separate |
## Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                                                            | Trade-offs / Mitigations                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decidable disagreements.** People can disagree about a boundary, a fold, or a coverage criterion without talking past each other. | **More words on the page.** Mitigate by applying always-unpack mainly to normative surfaces and repeating a single wholenessSituation record. |
| **Fewer category errors.** Order/time and membership stop leaking into part–whole chains.                                           | **Up-front effort.** Mitigate with the disambiguation table and lintable trigger list.                                                        |
| **Better evolution stories.** Reboundary/rephase/reorder changes are narratable without “it’s still the whole” confusion.           | **Temporary uncertainty.** Mitigate via Candidate-Set Notes rather than premature hardening.                                                  |
| **Cleaner role/method discourse.** “Turnkey” becomes a coverage statement tied to A.15 rather than a vague wholeness claim.         | **Learning curve.** Mitigate with the System/Episteme examples and consistent headphrases.                                                    |

Quotable closer: **If “whole” matters, say what makes it one.**
## Rationale

Natural language compresses multiple modeling dimensions into a single word because that is efficient in conversation. In engineering and research, the same compression becomes a fault-line: boundary individuation, mereological inclusion, collection membership, procedural order, and lifecycle continuity behave differently under reasoning and composition.

FPF’s kernel already provides small, orthogonal “axes” to separate these dimensions: boundaries and interactions for inside/outside, typed parthood for different inclusion families, Γ flavours for different kinds of composition, and role–method–work for capability vs description vs occurrence.  A.6.H simply supplies the **linguistic steering wheel** that keeps authors from driving those axes with one overloaded noun.

The result is not pedantry; it is a mechanism for preventing downstream refactors and for making disagreements reviewable.
## SoTA-Echoing

SoTA-Pack: Viewpoint discipline + relation typing + boundary-aware responsibility (lexically enforced).

This section follows the required craft: claim → practice → source → alignment → adoption status.

| Tradition                                     | SoTA practice (post‑2015)                                                                                                                                                              | Primary source (post‑2015)                       | Alignment with this pattern                                                                                                                                                                           | Adoption status                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Systems and software architecture description | Architecture descriptions distinguish the entity-of-interest from its description and structure the discussion around concerns/viewpoints, including boundary and environment notions. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 ([ISO][1])               | A.6.H adopts the same “make the viewpoint explicit” stance, but operationalizes it at the lexical level: “whole” requires a boundary/environment clause rather than a rhetorical claim.               | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt viewpoint discipline; adapt by using trigger-word linting as an authoring aid.                 |
| Formal ontology and top-level standards       | Top-level ontology standards require explicit definitions of relations and discourage conflating distinct relation types under one label.                                              | ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 ([ISO][2])                  | A.6.H aligns by forcing “part-of” to resolve into a typed relation family, and by separating continuants (structure) from occurrent-like narratives (order/time).                                     | **Adopt.** Adopt explicit relation typing; keep the facet set minimal to preserve usability.                          |
| Enterprise architecture modeling languages    | Modeling standards distinguish structural relations such as composition vs aggregation, but many organizations still overload them informally.                                         | ArchiMate 3.2 Specification ([opengroup.org][3]) | A.6.H adapts the idea of “different structural relations,” but extends it with Portion/Phase and with a strict routing of order/time outside structure, which is often underspecified in EA practice. | **Adapt.** Adopt the “don’t overload one relation” instinct; adapt by adding explicit order/time and coverage facets. |
| Sociotechnical team boundary practice         | Organizational design methods treat team boundaries and cognitive load as first-class, because “a team as a whole” depends on coordination interfaces and role clarity.                | Team Topologies ([teamtopologies.com][4])        | A.6.H uses this as support for separating “collective membership” from “structural assembly” and for treating “ownership of the whole” as a boundary-and-responsibility claim, not a part claim.      | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt boundary salience; adapt by binding it to explicit wholeness facets and typed relations.       |
| Requirements engineering and specification quality | Requirements standards emphasize unambiguous, verifiable statements and explicit identification of the item being specified vs its documentation (referent vs description).        | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018                          | A.6.H operationalizes this at the lexical level by defining load-bearing surfaces and requiring rewrites into typed relations instead of overloaded “whole/part” prose.                               | **Adopt/Adapt.** Adopt verifiability discipline; adapt via WHOL triggers + Candidate-Set Notes.                       |
| Security engineering vocabulary               | “Integrity” is treated as a security property (unauthorized modification) and as constraint satisfaction, requiring explicit threat/assumption models.                                | NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 (2020) ([NIST][5])          | A.6.H’s integrity classification step prevents misrouting security/data integrity into wholeness/mereology and supports correct remediation.                                                         | **Adopt.** Treat integrity as quality unless explicitly wholeness/coherence.                                          |

Scale legality note: whenever “fraction/percentage/share” appears in wholeness talk, treat it as PortionOf with an explicit extensive measure μ and an additive rule, not as “a component,” to avoid covert scalarization and category mistakes.
