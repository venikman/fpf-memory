# Unified Scope Mechanism (USM): Context Slices & Scopes
> Pattern `A.2.6` · Stable
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

> **One-line summary.** Introduces a single, context-local **scope mechanism** for all holons: **`U.ContextSlice`** (where we reason and measure) and a family of **set-valued scope types** (**USM scope objects, `U.Scope`**), specialized as **`U.ClaimScope`** for epistemes (**G** in **F–G–R**), **`U.WorkScope`** for system capabilities, and **`U.PublicationScope`** for publication carriers; with one algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit) and uniform Cross-context handling (Bridge + CL).

**Replaces / deprecates.**
This pattern **supersedes** the scattered use of labels *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *universality* and *capability envelope* where they tried to stand in for the one scope mechanism. From now on:

* For epistemes, the only **scope type** is **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G** in F–G–R).
* For system capabilities, the only **scope type** is **`U.WorkScope`**.
* For publication carriers (views/cards/lanes), the only **scope type** is **`U.PublicationScope`**.
* The abstract architectural notion is **`U.Scope`** — a **set-valued USM object** over `ContextSliceSet` with its own algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit); it is **not** a `U.Characteristic` and MUST NOT appear in any `CharacteristicSpace`.

Legacy words (*applicability / envelope / generality / capability envelope*) MAY appear **only** as explanatory aliases in non‑normative notes.

**Cross‑references.**
— **C.2.3** (Unified Formality **F**) and **C.2.2** (F–G–R): this pattern **defines G** as `U.ClaimScope`.
— **A.2.2** (Capabilities): capability gating now **SHALL** use `U.WorkScope`.
— **Part B** (Bridges & CL): Cross‑context transfers **MUST** declare a Bridge with **CL**; CL affects **R**, not **F/G**.
— **Part E** (Publication discipline; e.g., **E.17 MVPK**): publication views/cards/lanes MAY declare `U.PublicationScope` to bound **where** a publication is admissible; `U.PublicationScope` MUST NOT widen the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope`. (USM supplies the scope calculus; Part E supplies publication discipline.)

This pattern gives **engineering managers and assurance architects** one vocabulary, one model, and one set of operations to talk about **where** a claim holds and **under which conditions** a system can deliver a piece of **Work**. It removes the need to remember whether a document said “applicability,” a model said “envelope,” or a safety plan said “capability envelope.” **Scope is scope.** The only distinction that matters is **what carries it**:

## Content

## Purpose & Audience

This pattern gives **engineering managers and assurance architects** one vocabulary, one model, and one set of operations to talk about **where** a claim holds and **under which conditions** a system can deliver a piece of **Work**. It removes the need to remember whether a document said “applicability,” a model said “envelope,” or a safety plan said “capability envelope.” **Scope is scope.** The only distinction that matters is **what carries it**:

* **Knowledge/episteme** → **Claim scope** (G).
* **System/capability** → **Work scope** (conditions under which Work at the promised measures is deliverable).

With USM, teams can:

* specify, compare, and compose scope **without translation games**;
* gate ESG and Method–Work steps with **observable, context‑local scope checks**;
* cross Contexts safely using Bridges and **explicit CL penalties** applied to **R**.

This pattern **defines** the **scope mechanism** (Context slices, set‑valued scopes, algebra, and guard usage) and the canonical **lexicon** (Claim scope (G), Work scope). It does **not** prescribe which Contexts must widen/narrow scope, nor which assurance levels are required; those are set by context‑local ESG and Method–Work policies, which SHALL reference the mechanisms defined here.
## Context

### Cross‑disciplinary pressures

Modern projects couple **formal specs**, **data‑driven models**, **safety cases**, and **operational playbooks**. Each artifact must say **where it is valid**—yet terminology drifts:

* Standards and specs often say *applicability* or *scope*.
* Modeling communities say *envelope*.
* Safety and performance documents speak about *capability envelope*.
* Knowledge patterns have used *generality* (G) as if it were “more abstract,” when we actually need “**where the statement holds**.”
### context‑local reasoning

FPF is context‑local: decisions, checks, and state assertions are **valid inside a bounded context**. Every practical question—*Is this claim usable here? Can this capability deliver that Work now?*—must be answered **on a concrete slice of context** (terminology, versions, environmental parameters, time selector **Γ\_time**). USM provides a first‑class object for such slices and a single scope calculus atop them.
### Minimal, composable trust math

In **F–G–R**:

* **F** (formality) is “how strictly a claim is expressed” (C.2.3).
* **G** must be “**where it holds**,” not “how abstract it sounds.”
* **R** measures evidence and decays/penalties (freshness, CL).

When **G** is a **set‑valued scope**, composition becomes precise: serial dependencies **intersect** scopes; parallel, independently supported lines can publish a **SpanUnion**—but only where each line is supported.
## Problem

1. **Synonym soup.** *Applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope*—different labels for the **same mechanism** led to mismatches in gating, review, and reuse.
2. **Abstraction confusion.** Calling G “generality” invited teams to treat “more abstract wording” as “broader scope,” silently masking unstated assumptions.
3. **Split mechanics.** Episteme vs system text used different algebra and guard language, though **the same set operations** were meant.
4. **Cross‑context opacity.** Transfers between Contexts lacked a shared carrier and a rule for what changes (trust) vs what stays (scope).
5. **Overloaded words.** *Validity* clashed with **Validation Assurance (LA)**; *operation/operational* clashed with **Work/Run** in A.15, producing governance ambiguity.
## Forces

| Force                                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One mechanism vs two worlds**                   | We must serve both **knowledge about the world** (claims) and **doing work in the world** (capabilities) **without** duplicating concepts.                       |
| **Locality vs interoperability**                  | Scope must be **context‑local** and precisely checkable, yet transferable across Contexts via Bridges **without redefining** the characteristic.                       |
| **Expressivity vs minimal vocabulary**            | Teams need to capture rich conditions (time windows, environment, versions) but not explode the lexicon into “envelope/applicability/…” variants.                |
| **Static content vs operational change**          | Claims may hold broadly while current operations are narrow (or vice versa). The mechanism must keep “what is true” and “what can be done” aligned yet distinct. |
| **Open‑world exploration vs closed‑world gating** | Exploration benefits from permissive drafts; **gates** require crisp, observable checks. The same scope object must support both.                                |
## Solution — Overview (preview; full definitions in Part 2)

**USM** introduces:

* **`U.ContextSlice`** — an addressable **slice of a bounded context** (terminology, parameter ranges, versions/Standards, and a mandatory **Γ\_time** selector). All scope checks are performed **on slices**.
* **`U.Scope`** — the abstract **set‑valued scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`.
* **Specializations:**
  **`U.ClaimScope`** (nick **G**) on `U.Episteme` (“**where the claim holds**”),
  **`U.WorkScope`** on `U.Capability` (“**where the capability can deliver Work at declared measures within qualification windows**”), and
  **`U.PublicationScope`** on publication carriers (“**where the publication surface is admissible**”).
* **One algebra:** serial **intersection**, parallel **SpanUnion** (only where supported), **translate** via Bridge (CL affects **R**, not **F/G**), and **widen / narrow / refit** operations for scope evolution.

**Lexical commitments (normative):**
— In normative text and guards, use **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, and **Publication scope**.  
— Do **not** name the characteristic “applicability/envelope/generality/capability envelope/**publication applicability**/validity.” Those words are permitted only as explanatory aliases in notes.
## Normative Definitions

### USM as a U.Mechanism.Intension (normalization for A.6.1/A.6.5)

**Intent.** This subsection makes the **USM** definition in A.2.6 explicitly conform to the
`U.Mechanism` *intension* requirements (A.6.1) and the `…Slot` / `…Ref` lexical discipline (A.6.5),
without changing USM’s meaning.

**USM Mechanism.Intension (normative; A.6.1 decomposition).**

* **Imports (USM).** `U.ContextSlice`, `U.ContextSliceSet`, Part B **Bridge/CL** (`U.Bridge`, `U.CongruenceLevel`), and `U.GammaTimePolicy`.
* **BaseType (USM).** `U.ContextSliceSet` (set‑valued scope objects range over sets of addressable `U.ContextSlice`).
* **SliceSet (USM).** `U.ContextSliceSet` (addressable `U.ContextSlice`s; see §6.1).
* **SubjectKind (USM).** `U.Scope` with kind specialisations:  
  `U.ClaimScope ⊑ U.Scope`, `U.WorkScope ⊑ U.Scope`, `U.PublicationScope ⊑ U.Scope`.
* **ExtentRule (USM).** The quantifier domain is the set of **well‑formed scope objects** over the SliceSet: `Extension(U.Scope, slice) = { S | S ⊆ U.ContextSliceSet }`.
* **ResultKind? (USM).** `U.Scope` (for operators that return scopes, e.g., `∩`, `SpanUnion`, `translate`).

**SlotIndex (USM) for operators/guards (normative; A.6.0:4.1.1 + A.6.5).**  
These SlotKinds are stable names for signatures, substitution laws, and guard templates; they are **not** additional data slots on carriers.

| SlotKind             | ValueKind              | refMode  | Meaning |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ScopeSlot`          | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | A scope object (set of slices) owned by a carrier |
| `LeftScopeSlot`      | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | Left scope operand (binary ops/relations) |
| `RightScopeSlot`     | `U.Scope`              | byRef    | Right scope operand (binary ops/relations) |
| `ScopeFamilySlot`    | `Set[U.Scope]`          | byRef    | Finite family of scopes (for `SpanUnion`) |
| `SliceSlot`          | `U.ContextSlice`       | byValue  | A single addressable slice (membership target) |
| `SliceSetSlot`       | `U.ContextSliceSet`    | byRef    | A finite target set of slices (coverage target) |
| `BridgeRef`          | `U.Bridge`             | byRef    | Bridge used for `translate` / Cross‑context guards |
| `CLSlot`             | `U.CongruenceLevel`    | byValue  | Congruence Level bound in Cross‑context guards |
| `GammaTimeSlot`      | `U.GammaTimePolicy`    | byValue  | Explicit `Γ_time` selector/policy bound in guards |

**OperationAlgebra (USM) with SlotSpecs (normative).**

* `member(SliceSlot, ScopeSlot)` — surface form: `SliceSlot ∈ ScopeSlot`.
* `subset(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — surface form: `LeftScopeSlot ⊆ RightScopeSlot`.
* `intersect(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot) → U.Scope` — surface form: `LeftScopeSlot ∩ RightScopeSlot`.
* `spanUnion(ScopeFamilySlot) → U.Scope` — surface form: `SpanUnion(ScopeFamilySlot)`.
* `translate(BridgeRef, ScopeSlot) → U.Scope` — Cross‑context mapping via Bridge.
* `widen(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — Δ‑move, requires `LeftScopeSlot ⊂ RightScopeSlot`.
* `narrow(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — Δ‑move, requires `RightScopeSlot ⊂ LeftScopeSlot`.
* `refit(LeftScopeSlot, RightScopeSlot)` — normalization, requires `LeftScopeSlot = RightScopeSlot`.

**Derived guard predicates (USM).**

* `coversSlice(ScopeSlot, SliceSlot) := (SliceSlot ∈ ScopeSlot)`.
* `coversSet(ScopeSlot, SliceSetSlot) := (SliceSetSlot ⊆ ScopeSlot)`.

**LawSet (USM).** Serial composition uses **intersection**; parallel publication uses **SpanUnion** only with an explicit independence justification (§7.3).

**AdmissibilityConditions (USM).** Scope coverage predicates MUST be **tri‑state** under unknowns: unknown inputs yield **unknown**, and guards MUST either (a) **abstain** (fail closed) or (b) **degrade** trust in the admitting decision via **R**; unknown MUST NOT be implicitly coerced to `false`/`0`. (See also §7.1 and §10.1.)

**Applicability (USM).** USM governs **Claim/Work/Publication** scope objects inside a `U.BoundedContext`; coverage judgments are evaluated on explicit `U.ContextSlice` tuples (§6.1) and are not comparable/scorable as CHR values.

**Audit (USM).** Record scope‑aware decisions with the `TargetSlice` tuple, guard outcomes, and any Bridge+CL used (see §14.1).

**Transport (USM).** Cross‑context usage is **Bridge‑only** with explicit **CL**; CL penalties apply to `R_eff = R · Φ(CL)` and MUST NOT rewrite **F** or **G** (§7.4/§7.5).

**Γ_timePolicy (USM).** `Γ_time` is mandatory in slices and guards (§8.2); implicit “latest” is forbidden.

**PlaneRegime (USM).** Not applicable to set‑valued scope objects (no `CL^plane` effect on scopes).

**Mechanism specialisation (USM; A.6.1:4.2.1).** A bounded context MAY publish a specialisation of USM as either a refinement `USM′ ⊑ USM` (tighten LawSet/AdmissibilityConditions) or an extension `USM ⊑⁺ USM′` (add new operators/slots). Any such specialisation SHALL (i) name its parent (`USM`), (ii) declare the morphism kind (`⊑` vs `⊑⁺`), (iii) preserve the same BaseType and SlotKinds for inherited operators (no renaming), (iv) avoid adding new mandatory inputs to inherited signatures. It MAY narrow ValueKinds/refModes monotonically and add admissibility constraints, but MUST remain substitutable for the inherited USM operators.
### U.ContextSlice — where scope is evaluated

**Definition.** `U.ContextSlice` is an addressable, context‑local selection of a bounded context comprising:

* **Vocabulary & roles.** The active terminology, role bindings, and local dictionaries.
* **Standards & versions.** Concrete versioned interfaces, schemas, notations, or service Standards in force.
* **Environment selectors.** Named parameters/ranges (e.g., temp, humidity, platform, jurisdiction, dataset cohort).
* **Time selector `Γ_time`.** A **mandatory** selector for the temporal frame of reference (point, window, or policy), disallowing implicit “latest”.

**Semantics.** All scope checks, guards, and compositions are evaluated **inside** an explicitly named `U.ContextSlice`. Cross‑context or cross‑slice usage MUST be mediated by a Bridge (Part B) with an explicit CL rating; see §7.4.

**Addressability.** A slice MUST be identifiable via a canonical tuple (Context, vocab‑id, Standard/version ids, env selector(s), `Γ_time`). A slice MAY be a singleton or a finite set if a guard tests multiple coherent sub‑conditions. 

**Slice key (minimal).** A `U.ContextSlice` **SHALL** be addressable by a tuple containing at least: `(Context, Standard/version ids (if any), environment selectors, Γ_time)`. Contexts MAY extend this tuple (e.g., vocab/roleset ids).
### U.Scope — the abstract set‑valued scope property (USM kind; not a CSLC measurement)

**Definition.** `U.Scope ⊆ ContextSliceSet` is a **set‑valued USM property** whose values are sets of `U.ContextSlice` where a given statement, behavior, or capability is **fit‑for‑use**. It is **not** numeric; its internal order is the subset relation `⊆`. There is no “unit”. The primitive judgement is **membership**: `slice ∈ Scope`.  

**Guard (normative).** `U.Scope`, `U.ClaimScope (G)`, `U.WorkScope`, and `U.PublicationScope` are **not** `U.Characteristic`s in the A.17/CSLC sense; do **not** include them as slots in any `U.CharacteristicSpace`, and do **not** attach normalizations/scores to them. They are **USM scope objects**.

**Operations.** USM admits:

* **Intersection `∩`** (serial composition).
* **SpanUnion** (parallel, independently supported coverage) **only when an explicit named independence assumption is declared** (features/axes named, validity window stated, evidence class cited). See **A.6.1/USM LawSet** for the normative template.
* **Translate** (Cross‑context mapping via Bridge).
* **Widen / Narrow** (monotone changes to the set).
* **Refit** (content‑preserving re‑expression; set equality).

**Locality.** `U.Scope` values are defined and reasoned about **context‑locally**. Translation between Contexts never occurs implicitly; see §7.4.
### U.ClaimScope (nick G) — scope of a claim (episteme)

**Carrier.** `U.Episteme` (claims, specifications, theories, policies).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where the **claim holds** as stated. This is **G** in the F–G–R triple. **G is not “abstraction level”**; it is the applicability area of the claim.

**Expression.** Authors SHALL declare Claim scope as explicit predicates or condition blocks (assumptions, parameter ranges, cohorts, platform/Standard versions, `Γ_time` windows).

**Path composition (serial).** Along any essential dependency path supporting the claim, the effective scope is the **intersection** of contributors’ Claim scopes (see §7.2). Empty intersection makes the path inapplicable.

**Parallel support.** Where **independent** lines of support justify disjoint areas, the episteme MAY publish a **SpanUnion** (see §7.3) limited strictly to the covered slices.

**Δ‑moves.**

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S ⊂ S′.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Replace scope S with S′ such that S′ ⊂ S.
* **Refit.** Replace S with S′ where S′ = S (normalization, re‑parametrization).
* **Translate.** Map S across Contexts via a declared Bridge; CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G**.

**Orthogonality.** Changes in **F** (form of expression) or **D/AT** (detail/abstraction tiers) do not change **G** unless the declared area of validity changes.
### U.WorkScope — scope of doing Work (capability)

**Carrier.** `U.Capability` (a system’s ability to deliver specified `U.Work`).

**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` (conditions, Standards, platforms, operating parameters, `Γ_time`) under which the capability can **deliver the intended Work** at the declared **measures**, within declared **qualification windows**.

**Expression.** Capability owners SHALL declare **`U.WorkScope`** as explicit **conditions/constraints over `U.ContextSlice` only** (environment, platforms, Standards by version, resource regimes, `Γ_time`). Quantitative deliverables and operation windows are **not** part of the scope value:  
* Declare targets as **`U.WorkMeasures`** (e.g., latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε) bound in guards (WG‑2).  
* Declare inspection/recertification policies as **`U.QualificationWindow`** bound in guards (WG‑3).  
The use‑time admission requires **all** of: `WorkScope covers JobSlice` **AND** `WorkMeasures satisfied` **AND** `QualificationWindow holds`.

**Method–Work gating.** A Work step’s guard MUST check that the target slice is **covered** by the capability’s Work scope **and** that required measures and qualification windows are satisfied.

**Composition and Δ‑moves.** Work scope uses the **same algebra** as Claim scope (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit). Translation across Contexts follows §7.4.

**Separation from knowledge.** Work scope does **not** assert a proposition about the world; it asserts **deliverability** of Work under conditions. Evidence for deliverability feeds **R** (Reliability) via measurements and monitoring.

**Required guard facets (capabilities).**  
* **`U.WorkMeasures` (mandatory).** A set of measurable targets with units and tolerated ranges, evaluated on the JobSlice.  
* **`U.QualificationWindow` (mandatory for operational use).** A time policy (point/window/rolling) stating when the capability is considered qualified; evaluated at `Γ_time`.  
These facets are **separate** from `U.WorkScope` and live in the **R‑lane** (assurance). They MUST be referenced in Method–Work guards (see §10.3 WG‑2/WG‑3).
### U.PublicationScope — scope of a publication (view/surface)

**Carrier.** Publication carriers (e.g., **PublicationSurface/InteropSurface** views/cards/lanes in Part E; MVPK faces).
**Meaning.** The set of `U.ContextSlice` where a **publication** (a view/card/lane about some object or morphism) is **admissible for use** without introducing claims beyond its underlying carrier.

**Relation to other scopes (normative).**
* If the publication is **about an episteme `E`**:  
  `PublicationScope(view_E) ⊆ ClaimScope(E)`.
* If the publication is **about a capability `C`**:  
  `PublicationScope(view_C) ⊆ WorkScope(C)`.
* If the publication is **about a composition and/or crosses Contexts**:  
  `PublicationScope(view) ⊆ translate(Bridge, ⋂ scopes of contributors)`; CL penalties apply to **R** only (scope set membership is unaffected).

**Expression.** Authors SHALL declare `U.PublicationScope` as explicit predicates over `U.ContextSlice` (Context, Standard/version ids, environment selectors, `Γ_time`). It MAY be **narrower** than the underlying scope (e.g., due to pin availability, labeling, or audience constraints) but MUST NOT be wider.

**Algebra & Δ‑moves.** Inherits the USM algebra (∩ / SpanUnion / translate / widen / narrow / refit). **Widen** is permitted only when the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope` widens accordingly; otherwise the publication MAY refit or narrow.

**Orthogonality to measurement.** `U.PublicationScope` is a **USM scope object** (set‑valued), not a CHR Characteristic and MUST NOT appear as a slot in a `U.CharacteristicSpace`.

**View refinement (profiles).** When a stricter publication profile/view **refines** another (e.g., a typed card that requires additional pins), its `U.PublicationScope` **MUST NOT** be wider than that of the less formal view.
## Scope Algebra

### Membership & Coverage

* **Membership judgement.** `slice ∈ Scope` is the primitive check.
* **Coverage guard.** A guard “Scope **covers** TargetSlice” means either:

  * **singleton:** `TargetSlice ∈ Scope`, or
  * **set:** `TargetSet ⊆ Scope`.
* **No implicit expansion.** Absent an explicit declaration, guards MUST NOT treat “close” slices as covered; widening requires a ΔG+ change.

**Tri‑state admissibility under unknowns (normative; aligns A.6.1).**

* If any required input to a membership/coverage check is **unknown** (missing slice selector, unknown Standard version, unmappable Bridge leg, unspecified `Γ_time`, etc.), the check result is **unknown**, not `false`.
* Guards MUST either **abstain** (fail closed) or explicitly route the outcome through an **R‑lane degradation** policy; unknown MUST NOT be coerced to `false/0`.
### Serial Composition (Intersection)

**Rule S‑INT (serial).** For an essential dependency chain `C1 → C2 → … → Ck` that supports a claim/capability, the effective scope along that chain is:

```
Scope_serial = ⋂_{i=1..k} Scope(Ci)
```

If `Scope_serial = ∅`, the chain is **inapplicable** and MUST NOT contribute to published scope.

**Monotonicity.** Adding a new essential dependency can only narrow (or leave unchanged) the serial scope.
### Parallel Support (SpanUnion)

**Rule P‑UNION (parallel).** If there exist **independent** support lines `L₁,…,Lₙ` for the **same** claim/capability, each with serial scope `S_i`, the publisher MAY declare:

```
Scope_published = SpanUnion({S_i})  =  ⋃_{i=1..n} S_i
```

**Constraints.**

* Independence MUST be justified (different support lines must not rely on the same weakest link).
* The union MUST NOT exceed the union of supported slices; “hopeful” areas are disallowed.
* Publishers SHOULD annotate coverage density/heterogeneity (informative) to aid R assessment, but numeric “coverage” is not part of G.
* **Independence criterion.** Support lines in a **SpanUnion** MUST be partitioned so that each line has a set of **essential components** disjoint from the others’ essential components (no shared weakest link). The partition (or a certificate thereof) SHALL be referenced in the publication.
### Why a G-ladder/levels/scales is not needed (and must not be introduced)

**1) G is not an ordinal scale; it is set-valued.**
Under **USM**, `U.ClaimScope` is a **set‑valued** **USM scope object** over `U.ContextSlice`. The only well‑typed primitives are **membership** and **set operations** (`⊆`, `∩`, `⋃`). Imposing ordinal “levels” such as **G0…Gk** violates the type discipline and produces non‑invariant behavior (the **same set** could be “rated” with different numbers under different heuristics). (See also LEX‑CHR‑STRICT.)

**2) G composes via `∩` / `SpanUnion`, not via `min` / `avg`.**
USM already fixes composition: along a **dependent path** use **intersection**; across **independent support lines** publish **SpanUnion**. None of these operations relies on (or preserves) any linear order. An ordinal “G ladder” invites people to take **minimums/averages**, which is **incorrect** for sets and breaks the established algebra.

**3) A G ladder drags in “abstraction level,” which is orthogonal.**
Early “G ladders” effectively encoded **abstraction/typing** (instances → patterns → formal classes/types → up‑to‑iso). That is valuable **didactics**, but **not applicability**. We have already separated these concerns: **abstraction** is captured, if needed, by **`U.AbstractionTier (AT)`** as an optional facet; **applicability** is **`U.ClaimScope (G)`**.

**4) A G ladder breaks locality and Bridge semantics.**
Cross‑context transfer maps a **set** `Scope` via a **Bridge** and penalizes **R** by **CL**. There is no canonical way to “translate” an **ordinal G level** between Contexts: the mapped area may be **strictly narrower** or differently factored. Level numbers would become non‑portable, causing hidden loss or inflation of trust. With USM, we **translate sets** and keep the CL penalty where it belongs—**in R**, not in G.

**5) A G ladder duplicates ESG guards without adding decision power.**
What teams often want to “compress into a G number” is actually (a) the **quality of expression** and (b) the **completeness** of the declared scope. The first is an **F threshold** (e.g., require **`U.Formality ≥ F4`** so the scope is predicate‑like and addressable); the second is handled by explicit **ESG guards**: “**Scope covers TargetSlice**,” “**`Γ_time` is specified**,” and “**freshness window holds**” (R‑lane). A ladder for G adds confusion but no additional control.

**Normative directive.**
`U.ClaimScope (G)` **SHALL** remain a **set‑valued USM scope object**; **no ordinal or numeric ladder SHALL be defined** for G. If a profile needs scalar reporting, it MAY publish an explicit **report‑only** proxy **`CoverageMetric(G)`**, but **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT substitute for `G`** in norms, gates, bridge semantics, or CL routing. Authoring and gating **SHOULD** use **F thresholds** (C.2.3) and **explicit guard predicates** (A.2.6) rather than pseudo‑levels of G.
### Translation across Contexts (Bridge & CL)

**Rule T‑BRIDGE.** To use a scope in a different bounded context (room), an explicit **Bridge** MUST be declared with:

* **Mapping.** A documented mapping from source to target `U.ContextSlice` vocabulary/characteristics.
* **Congruence Level (CL).** A rating of mapping congruence.
* **Loss notes.** Any known losses, assumptions, or non‑isomorphisms.

**Effect.** The mapped scope is `T(Scope)` in the target Context. **CL penalties apply to R** (the trust in support/evidence), **not to F or G**. If mapping is coarse, the publisher SHOULD also narrow the mapped scope to the area where losses are negligible (best practice, not a requirement).
### Δ‑Operations (Widen, Narrow, Refit)

* **ΔG+ (widen).** Monotone expansion: `S ⊂ S′`. Requires new support or stronger bridges.
* **ΔG− (narrow).** Monotone restriction: `S′ ⊂ S`. Often used to remove areas invalidated by new findings.
* **Refit.** `S′ = S` after normalization (e.g., re‑parameterization, changing units, factoring common predicates). Refit MUST NOT alter membership.

**Refit (normalization).** A refit **MUST preserve membership** exactly (S′ = S). Any change that alters boundary inclusion (due to rounding, unit conversion, discretization) is a ΔG± change, not a refit.

**Edition triggers.** Any change that alters the published set (ΔG±) is a content change and MAY trigger a new edition per Context policy (see A.2.x on editions). Refit is not a content change.
### Invariants

* **I‑LOCAL.** All scope evaluation is **context‑local**. Cross‑context usage MUST follow §7.4.
* **I‑SERIAL.** Serial scope is an **intersection**; it cannot grow by adding dependencies.
* **I‑PARALLEL.** Parallel scope MAY grow by union, but only where **independently supported**.
* **I‑WLNK.** Weakest‑link applies to **F** and **R** on dependency paths; **G** follows set rules (∩ / ⋃).
* **I‑IDS.** Idempotence: Intersecting or unioning a set with itself does not change it.
* **I‑EMPTY.** Empty scope is a first‑class value; guards MUST treat it as “not applicable”.
### Empty & Partial Scopes

* **Empty scope (`∅`).** The claim/capability is **currently not usable anywhere** in the Context; guards MUST fail.
* **Partial scope.** Publishers SHOULD avoid “global” language when actual scope is thin; instead, publish explicit slices and (informatively) coverage hints to guide R assessment.
## Locality, Time & Version Semantics

### context‑locality

Scopes are **owned and evaluated** within a `U.BoundedContext`. State assertions (ESG/RSG) and Method–Work gates MUST NOT assume that a scope declared in another Context applies verbatim; see §7.4.
### Time selector Γ_time

Every scope declaration and every guard MUST specify a **`Γ_time` selector** (point, window, or policy such as “rolling 180 days”) whenever time‑dependent assumptions exist. Implicit “latest” is forbidden. When `Γ_time` differs between contributors, serial intersection resolves the overlap.
### Standards, versions & notations

Scope predicates SHALL name Standards/interfaces/schemas **by version**. Changing symbols/notations with a faithful mapping does not change **G** (it may change **CL** for the mapping and thus affect **R**).
### Determinism of evaluation

Given fixed inputs (slice tuple, declared scope), the membership judgement MUST be deterministic. Guards SHALL fail closed (no membership ⇒ no use).
### Interaction with R (freshness & decay)

For empirical claims and operational capabilities, **R** typically binds evidence freshness windows. Scope does not decay with time; **trust in the support** does. Guards MAY combine “Scope covers” with “Evidence freshness holds” as separate predicates.
## Lexical Discipline (Part E compliance)

**L‑USM‑1 (names).** Use **Claim scope (G)** for epistemes, **Work scope** for capabilities, and **Publication scope** for publication carriers. Use **Scope** only when discussing the abstract mechanism. Avoid naming any **characteristic** as “applicability,” “envelope,” “generality,” “capability envelope,” or “validity”.

**L‑USM‑2 (Work/Run).** Prefer **Work/Run** vocabulary from A.15 for system execution contexts. Do not introduce “operation/operating” as characteristic names; use **Work scope**.

**L‑USM‑3 (Validation).** “Validation/Validate” remain reserved for **LA** in assurance lanes (Part B). Do not name a scope object “validity”.

**L‑USM‑4 (Domain).** “Domain” is a descriptive convenience. Scopes are evaluated on **Context slices**; guards SHALL reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**L‑USM‑5 (First mention).** On first use in a Context, include the parenthetical nick: *“Claim scope (**G**)”* to preserve the F–G–R mapping.
## Guard Patterns (ESG & Method–Work)

### Common guard shape

A scope‑aware guard has the form:

```
Guard := ScopeCoverage AND TimePolicy AND (EvidenceFreshness?) AND (BridgePolicy?)
```

**Admissibility note (normative; A.6.1 alignment).** If `ScopeCoverage` is **unknown** (due to unknown slice keys, unmappable translation, missing `Γ_time`, etc.), the guard MUST NOT silently treat this as `false`. It MUST either abstain (fail closed) or apply an explicit R‑lane degradation policy.

Where:

* **ScopeCoverage**: `Scope covers TargetSlice` (singleton or finite set), see §7.1.
* **TimePolicy**: explicit `Γ_time` selector(s); implicit “latest” is forbidden (§8.2).
* **EvidenceFreshness**: optional R‑lane freshness/decay predicates; **separate** from ScopeCoverage (§8.5).
* **BridgePolicy**: required if the Scope and TargetSlice are in **different Contexts**; declares Bridge, CL, loss notes (§7.4).

The guard **fails closed** (no membership ⇒ denial), and evaluation is **deterministic** given the slice tuple (§8.4).
### ESG guard families (epistemes)

**EG‑1 - ClaimScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
The state transition MUST include a predicate:

```
U.ClaimScope(episteme) covers TargetSlice
```

* **Singleton**: `TargetSlice ∈ ClaimScope`.
* **Finite set**: `TargetSet ⊆ ClaimScope`.

**EG‑2 - Formality threshold (if required by ESG).**
When rigor is gated, the guard MUST reference C.2.3:

```
U.Formality(episteme) ≥ F_k
```

**EG‑3 - Evidence freshness (R‑lane).**
If the state implies trust, a separate predicate MUST assert freshness windows for bound evidence:

```
Fresh(evidence, window)  AND  (NoExpiredBindings)
```

**EG‑4 - Cross‑context usage.**
If `TargetSlice.Context ≠ episteme.Context`, the guard MUST require a declared Bridge and CL:

```
Bridge(source=episteme.Context, target=TargetSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

> **Effect:** CL penalties apply to **R**, not to **F/G** (§7.4). The ESG guard MAY also **narrow** the mapped Claim scope when mapping losses are known.

**EG‑5 - ΔG triggers.**
If the transition publishes a **wider** Claim scope (ΔG+), the guard MUST capture the new support or the new Bridge and, if Context policy so dictates, mint a new edition (PhaseOf).

**EG‑6 - Independence for SpanUnion (when claiming parallel scope).**
When the episteme declares a **SpanUnion** across independent lines, the guard MUST include an **independence justification** (pointer to the support partition). No independence ⇒ no union.

*(Informative note.)* Managers often combine EG‑1 (coverage) + EG‑2 (F threshold) + EG‑3 (freshness) for “Effective” or “Approved” states, and EG‑4 when adopting claims across Contexts.
### Method–Work guard families (capabilities)

**WG‑1 - WorkScopeCoverage (mandatory).**
A capability can be used to deliver a Work step only if:

```
U.WorkScope(capability) covers JobSlice
```

**WG‑2 - `U.WorkMeasures` satisfied** (mandatory for deliverables).
Guards MUST bind quantitative measures that the capability promises in the JobSlice:

```
SLO/target measures satisfied (latency ≤ L, throughput ≥ T, tolerance ≤ ε, … )
```

**WG‑3 - `U.QualificationWindow` holds** (mandatory for operational use).
Operational guards MUST assert that qualification windows (qualification/inspection/recert intervals) hold **at `Γ_time`**:

```
ValidityWindow(capability) holds at Γ_time
```

**WG‑4 - Cross‑context use of capability.**
If the JobSlice is in another Context:

```
Bridge(source=capability.Context, target=JobSlice.Context)  AND  CL ≥ c
```

CL penalties affect **R** (confidence in deliverability), **not** Work scope; however, the guard SHOULD narrow the mapped Work scope to account for known mapping losses.

**WG‑5 - Δ(WorkScope).**
When widening Work scope (new operating ranges/platforms), the guard MUST require evidence at the new slices (measures + qualification windows). Refit (e.g., new units/parametrization) requires no new evidence.
### Bridge‑aware guard macro (reusable)

A reusable macro for Cross‑context guards:

```
Guard_XContext(Scope, TargetSlice) :=
    exists Bridge b: (b.source = owner(Scope).Context AND b.target = TargetSlice.Context)
AND CL(b) ≥ c
AND Scope’ = translate(b, Scope)
AND Scope’ covers TargetSlice
AND (Apply CL penalty to R)
```

* **Owner(Scope).** The carrier that declares the scope: an **Episteme** (for `U.ClaimScope`), a **Capability** (for `U.WorkScope`), or a **Publication carrier** (for `U.PublicationScope`).  
* **Translate(b, Scope).** The partial mapping of a set of source slices to target slices induced by Bridge **b**. If a source slice is unmappable, it is dropped. The result is a set of target slices; **CL penalties apply to R only**.
* **Penalty to R**: applied per trust calculus; F and G remain as declared.
### Selector policy (Γ\_time)

All ESG and Method–Work guards MUST spell out **`Γ_time`**:

* **Point** (“as of 2026‑03‑31T00:00Z”).
* **Window** (“rolling 180 days”).
* **Policy** (“last lab calibration within 90 days”).

Implicit “latest” is not allowed. If multiple contributors declare different policies, **serial intersection** computes the overlap (§8.2).

| **CC‑USM‑2 (Set‑valued).**            | Scope characteristics are **set‑valued** over `U.ContextSlice`. Implementations MUST support **membership**, **intersection**, **SpanUnion**, **translate**, **widen/narrow**, **refit**.      |
| **CC‑USM‑3 (Coverage guards).**       | ESG and Method–Work guards **MUST** use `Scope covers TargetSlice` predicates and **MUST** specify `Γ_time`. Guards fail closed.                                                               |
| **CC‑USM‑4 (Serial intersection).**   | Along essential dependency paths, effective scope **SHALL** be the **intersection**; empty intersection invalidates the path.                                                                  |

For any publication **about** an episteme or capability, `PublicationScope` **MUST** be a subset of the underlying `U.ClaimScope`/`U.WorkScope`. Cross‑context publications **MUST** cite Bridge + CL; CL penalties **apply to R only** (scope membership unchanged). |
| **CC‑USM‑11 (Separation).**           | Scope coverage checks and evidence freshness/assurance checks **MUST** be separate predicates (G vs R).                                                                                        |
| **CC‑USM‑12 (Versioned Standards).**  | Scope predicates **SHALL** name Standards/interfaces by **version**; changes in notations with faithful mapping do not change **G** (may change CL for R).                                     |
| **CC‑USM‑13 (Min‑info publication).** | Published scopes **SHOULD** enumerate slices or predicate blocks sufficient to re‑evaluate membership without external folklore.                                                               |

| **CC‑USM‑15 (Unknown handling).**     | Membership/coverage evaluation MUST be tri‑state under unknown inputs: unknown → {abstain (fail closed) \| degrade via R}; unknown MUST NOT be coerced to `false/0`. |
## Worked Examples

> Each example declares the Context, the scope, the target slice, and shows the guard outcome. Where relevant, serial intersection, SpanUnion, and Bridge & CL are illustrated.

### Research claim (controlled narrative → predicate)

* **Context:** `MaterialsLab@2026`.
* **Episteme:** claim “Adhesive X retains ≥85 % tensile strength on Al6061 for 2 h at 120–150 °C.”
* **Claim scope (G):** `{substrate=Al6061, temp∈[120,150]°C, dwell≤2h, Γ_time = window(1y), rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Target slice:** `{substrate=Al6061, temp=140 °C, dwell=90 min, Γ_time=2026‑04‑02, rig=Calib‑v3}`.
* **Guard (EG‑1, EG‑2):** `covers(TargetSlice)` **true**; `U.Formality ≥ F4` **true** (predicates in spec).
* **Outcome:** state transition allowed (freshness checked separately under R).
### Cross‑context use of the research claim

* **target Context:** `AssemblyFloor@EU‑PLANT‑B`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping of rigs and temp measurement correction; **CL=2** (loss: ±2 °C bias).
* **Mapped Claim scope:** `translate(Bridge, G)` narrows temp to `[122,148]°C`.
* **Guard (EG‑4):** Bridge present, `CL≥2` **true**; **R** is penalized per Φ(CL).
* **Outcome:** allowed; **G** remains the mapped set; **R** lowered.
### Capability: robotic weld Work scope

* **Context:** `RobotCell‑Weld@2026`.
* **Capability:** “Weld seam W at bead width 2.5 ± 0.3 mm, cycle ≤ 12 s.”
* **Work scope:** `{humidity<60 %, current∈[35,45]A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=rolling(90d), controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Job slice:** `{humidity=55 %, current=40A, wire=ER70S‑6, Γ_time=now, controller=FW‑2.1}`.
* **Guards (WG‑1..3):** coverage **true**; measures satisfied; qualification window **true** (controller certified 60 d ago).
* **Outcome:** capability admitted for this Work.
### Serial intersection (API + dataset compatibility)

* **Claim A (API Standard):** `v2.3` request schema with constraint “idempotent under retry”.
* **Claim B (Dataset cohort):** “metrics valid for cohort K with schema `ds‑14`”.
* **Composition:** service S depends on both A and B → **serial intersection** of Claim scopes: `{api=v2.3} ∩ {cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}`.
* **Target slice:** `{api=v2.3, cohort=K, schema=ds‑14}` → membership **true**.
* **Any drift (e.g., `ds‑15`)** empties the intersection ⇒ path inapplicable.
### Parallel support (SpanUnion) in a safety case

* **Line L1:** tests on **dry asphalt** support braking property; scope `S1={surface=dry, speed≤50 km/h}`.
* **Line L2:** simulations for **wet asphalt**; scope `S2={surface=wet, speed≤40 km/h}`.
* **Published scope:** `SpanUnion({S1,S2})` = `{(dry, ≤50), (wet, ≤40)}` with independence note (L1 empirical, L2 model‑validated).
* **Guard:** allowed; union does **not** include `(wet, 45)` because not supported.
### ML model deployment across Contexts

* **Model claim:** “AUC ≥ 0.92 on cohort K, pipeline P, features F, `Γ_time=rolling(180d)`.”
* **Claim scope:** `{cohort=K, pipeline=P, features=F, Γ_time=rolling(180d)}`.
* **target Context:** product `On‑Device@v7`, features `F’` (subset), pipeline `P’`.
* **Bridge:** declared mapping `F→F’`, `P→P’`, **CL=1** (notably lossy).
* **Guard:** Bridge present; `translate(G)` covers a **strict subset**; CL=1 penalizes **R** strongly; ESG requires **F≥F5** (executable semantics) and **freshness < 90 d**.
* **Outcome:** allowed only for the covered subset; adoption flagged with reduced **R**.
## Playbooks (Informative)

### Manager’s 6‑step adoption checklist

1. **Name the TargetSlice.** Write the tuple (Context, versions, environment params, `Γ_time`).
2. **Check scope coverage.** “Claim/Work scope covers TargetSlice?” If **no**, either **ΔG+** (publish wider scope with support) or **decline**.
3. **Check rigor if gated.** If ESG requires it, ensure `U.Formality ≥ F_k`.
4. **Check evidence freshness (R).** Validate windows/decay policies; do not conflate with coverage.
5. **Bridge if Cross‑context.** Require declared Bridge, CL, and loss notes; accept **R** penalties.
6. **Record the decision.** Keep the slice and guard outcomes with the StateAssertion (auditability).
### Architect’s design rubric for scopes

* **Prefer predicates over prose.** Name parameters, ranges, Standards by **version**, and `Γ_time`.
* **Factor common conditions.** Use Refit to normalize units and factor shared predicates; do not widen by stealth.
* **Partition support lines.** If you plan a **SpanUnion**, document independence up front.
* **Keep scope thin & honest.** Publish what you can support; add slices as support appears (ΔG+).
* **Design Bridges early.** When interop is planned, sketch mapping characteristics and **expected CL**; plan **R** penalties.
### Review anti‑patterns & fixes

| Anti‑pattern                                    | Why it’s wrong                   | Fix                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Latest” time by default                        | Non‑deterministic; violates §8.2 | Declare `Γ_time` explicitly (point/window/policy)          |
| Using “domain” in guards                        | Not addressable; hides slices    | Replace with concrete `U.ContextSlice` tuples              |
| Treating “more abstract wording” as wider scope | Abstraction ≠ applicability      | Keep **AT/D** separate; widen **G** only with explicit ΔG+ |
| Publishing union without independence           | Overstates coverage              | Justify independence or publish serial intersection only   |
| Cross‑context use without Bridge                   | Silent semantic drift            | Require Bridge + CL; apply **R** penalties                 |
### Minimal DSL snippet for scope blocks (illustrative)

```
claimScope:
  Context: MaterialsLab@2026
  Standards:
    - rig: Calib-v3
    - api: v2.3
  env:
    substrate: Al6061
    temp: [120, 150] # °C
    dwell: { max: "2h" }
  gamma_time: { window_days: 365 }
```

*(Illustrative only; the specification does not mandate a particular syntax.)*
### Profiles as Scope configurations (informative)

**Idea.** A **Scope profile** is a **named, editioned configuration** that expands to a concrete `U.Scope` predicate block (over `U.ContextSlice`), used to avoid repetition and to keep declarations consistent across carriers.

**Rules.**
* **P1 (Expansion).** Profiles are macros: guards **MUST** expand them to explicit predicates before evaluating `Scope covers TargetSlice`.
* **P2 (Edition).** Profiles are editioned; changing a profile’s predicates is a content change for any carrier that references it.
* **P3 (No stealth widen).** A profile update MUST NOT implicitly widen a carrier’s published scope; ΔG+ must be explicit in that carrier.
* **P4 (Bridge awareness).** If a profile implies Cross‑context use, it MUST name the Bridge and CL policy; CL penalties apply to **R** only.
* **P5 (Locality).** Profiles are context‑local conveniences; they do not introduce new scope types.

**Examples (illustrative).**  
— An engineering context defines `Ops‑Lab‑v3` as a profile pinning Standards, environment selectors, and a rolling `Γ_time` policy; claims, capabilities, and publications may reference it as a shorthand.  
— A publication stack defines `TechCard‑Lite@Σ` as a profile that **narrows** `U.PublicationScope` to slices where required pins are available.
## Governance Hooks & Audits

### Governance metadata (normative)

Contexts that adopt USM SHALL record, per scope‑aware decision:

* **Owner.** Episteme (for Claim scope) or Capability (for Work scope).
* **TargetSlice tuple.** Context, vocab/roles, versioned Standards, environment selectors, **`Γ_time`**.
* **Guard outcomes.** Membership result, Bound measures (for Work scope), Freshness predicates (R).
* **Bridge info (if any).** Mapping summary, **CL**, loss notes, applied R penalty.
* **ΔG log.** Widen/narrow/refit; edition policy outcome.
### USM compliance levels (informative)

* **USM‑Ready.** Context declares adoption; editors trained; lexicon updated.
* **USM‑Guarded.** All ESG/Method–Work guards use Claim/Work scope and `Γ_time`.
* **USM‑Auditable.** Decision records include TargetSlice tuples and Bridge/CL details.
* **USM‑Composed.** Serial intersection and SpanUnion are implemented in composition tooling.
### Audit checklist (informative)

* Does each guard **name** a concrete **TargetSlice**?
* Is **membership** deterministically recomputable from published predicates?
* Are **freshness** and **coverage** separate predicates?
* For Cross‑context use: is there a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes?
* For parallel support: is **independence** justified?
### Risk controls (informative)

* **Silent widening.** Require ΔG+ review; flag any scope increase without new support/Bridge.
* **Opaque slices.** Disallow “domain” placeholders; enforce addressable selectors.
* **Time drift.** Require `Γ_time` policies (rolling windows) for time‑sensitive scopes.
## Cross‑Pattern Coordination

### With F–G–R (C.2.2)

* **G is Claim scope.** Use set algebra (∩ / SpanUnion).
* **F** remains the expression rigor (C.2.3); **R** captures evidence freshness and CL penalties.
* **Weakest‑link.** On dependency paths: **F\_composite = min(F)**, **R\_composite = min(R)**; **G** follows §7.2–§7.3 (set rules).
### With Formality (C.2.3)

* **No conflation.** Raising **F** does not change **G** unless scope predicates change.
* **Guarding rigor.** ESG may use `U.Formality ≥ F_k` alongside scope coverage.
### With Work & Run (A.15)

* **Work scope** aligns with the **execution context** of `U.Work`.
* Method–Work gates use **Work scope coverage** plus **measures** and **qualification windows**.
### With Bridges & CL (Part B)

* **CL only impacts R.** CL penalties reduce trust; they never rewrite **F** or **G**.
* **Best practice.** Narrow mapped scopes where mapping losses are material.
### With Capability governance (A.2.2)

* Capabilities MUST declare **Work scope**, **measures**, **qualification windows**; gates MUST verify all three.
* Capability refits that preserve the set (unit changes) are **Refit**, not Δ(WorkScope).
## Extended FAQ (informative)

**Q1. Is “Claim scope” the same as “domain”?**
**No.** “Domain” is descriptive and often fuzzy. **Claim scope** is **addressable**: it names concrete `U.ContextSlice` conditions and a **`Γ_time`** policy. Guards MUST reference slices, not generic “domains”.

**Q2. How do we express partial coverage across different cohorts or platforms?**
Declare each supported serial scope (`S₁, S₂, …`) and publish **SpanUnion({Sᵢ})** with independence justification. Do **not** include unsupported slices.

**Q3. Can raising F (formalizing) widen G?**
Only if the formalization **explicitly changes** the scope predicates (ΔG+). Formalization alone does not widen scope.

**Q4. What is the difference between Work scope and SLOs?**
**Work scope** is **where** the capability can deliver; **measures** within the guard are **what** it promises there (SLO targets). Both are required at use time (WG‑1..3).

**Q5. Can we assign numeric coverage to G?**
Not normatively. G is set‑valued. You MAY attach an **informative**, explicitly declared **`CoverageMetric(G)`** (e.g., a proportion under a pinned policy) to aid **R** assessment, but guards use set membership and **`CoverageMetric(G)` MUST NOT replace `G`**.

**Q6. How do we handle “latest data” scopes?**
You don’t. Declare a **`Γ_time`** policy (e.g., rolling 90 days). “Latest” is forbidden to ensure reproducible evaluation.

**Q7. How do we move a scope to another Context?**
Declare a **Bridge** with **CL** and loss notes; compute `translate(Bridge, Scope)`; apply CL penalty to **R**; consider narrowing the mapped set.

**Q8. What about abstraction level or detail?**
Keep **AT (AbstractionTier)** and **D (Detail/Resolution)** as orthogonal, optional annotations. They never substitute for **Claim/Work scope**.

**Q9. Can a capability’s Work scope be broader than a predecessor claim’s Claim scope on a dependency path?**
They are on different carriers. In a serial dependency, the **effective** scope is the **intersection**; the broader one does not dominate.

**Q10. When does an empty scope make sense?**
It indicates “not usable anywhere (here, now)”. Guards MUST fail. This is common during early drafting or after a refutation.

| Legacy wording                      | USM term                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

*(Use legacy terms only in explanatory notes; not in guards or conformance text.)*
### Minimal data model hints

**ContextSlice tuple (suggested keys):**
`Context`, `vocabId`, `rolesetId?`, `Standards: [{name, version}]`, `env: {param: range/value}`, `gamma_time: {point|window|policy}`.

**Claim scope block:**
`assumptions`, `cohorts`, `platforms/Standards`, `env`, `gamma_time`.

**Work scope block:**
`conditions (env/platform/Standards)`, `measures (targets & units)`, `validity_windows`, `gamma_time`.

*(These are informative; the spec does not mandate a concrete serialization.)*
### Pseudocode membership (illustrative)

```python
def covers(scope: Set[Slice], target: Union[Slice, Set[Slice]]) -> bool:
    if isinstance(target, Slice):
        return target in scope
    return target.issubset(scope)
```
## A.2.6:17. 4 Rationale - F‑Cluster Unification for A.2.6 (F.17 / F.18)

> **Intent.** This annex applies the **F‑cluster method** to triangulate **USM** terms against a diverse set of post‑2015 sources and communities (“Contexts”), and then fixes the **Unified Tech** and **Plain** names used in A.2.6. Results are ready for downstream lexicon entries (Part E) and guard templates (ESG / Method–Work).

### F.17 Unified Term Survey (UTS) — Method & Scope

**Contexts surveyed (SoTA, diverse):**

1. **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010** (architecture description)
2. **OMG Essence** (Kernel: Alphas, Work Products, States)
3. **NIST AI RMF 1.0/1.1** (trustworthy AI)
4. **ASME V\&V 40–2018 / FDA 2021–2023** (model credibility)
5. **W3C SHACL (2017+) / SHACL‑AF** (data constraints)
6. **OWL 2 / ontology engineering (2012+, current practice)**
7. **IETF BCP 14 (RFC 2119/8174)** (normative keywords & guard style)
8. **DO‑178C + DO‑333** (avionics, formal methods supplement)
9. **ISO 26262:2018/2025** (automotive functional safety)
10. **IEC 61508 (2010+, current revisions)** (basic safety)
11. **ACM Artifact Review & Badging v1.1** (reproducibility signals)
12. **MLOps/Cloud SLO practice (SRE / platform)** (operational guardrails)

**Survey focus (terms we align):** `U.ContextSlice`, generic **Scope** and set algebra, **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Bridge & CL**, **Γ\_time**, **widen/narrow/refit/translate**, **SpanUnion / serial intersection**, separation from **F** and **R**, avoidance of overloaded **validity/operation** terms.
### UTS Table (F.17) — Cross‑context term mapping

|  # | Context / Source      | Local label(s) (native)                                                     | Closest USM concept                                                                      | Notes on fit & deltas                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -: | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1 | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 | *Architecture context; environment; stakeholder concerns; viewpoints/views* | **ContextSlice** (addressable slice); **Scope** as view‑specific applicability           | 42010 is about **views in context**; it has no first‑class set‑valued scope char but aligns with “evaluate **in a concrete context**” → USM uses explicit **slice tuples**.                   |
|  2 | OMG Essence        | *Alpha State; Work Product State; Level of Detail (LoD)*                    | **Work scope** (guards), **Detail (D)** (LoD), **ESG/RSG**                               | Essence separates **status** (states) and **work evidence**; LoD is **detail**, not scope. USM treats **scope** as guardable membership over slices; states/LoD map to ESG & **D**, not to G. |
|  3 | NIST AI RMF        | *Context of use; validity, reliability, robustness; monitoring*             | **Claim scope (G)**; **R** freshness/monitoring                                          | “Context of use” = **where a claim/model holds** → maps to **G**. “Validity” is part of **R** vocabulary; we **avoid** naming the characteristic “validity” to prevent LA confusion.          |
|  4 | ASME V\&V 40 / FDA | *Context of use; credibility factors; verification/validation*              | **Claim scope (G)**; **R** (credibility)                                                 | Direct fit for G via “context of use”. Credibility/evidence freshness contribute to **R**, not to G; USM keeps them separate in guards.                                                       |
|  5 | W3C SHACL          | *Shapes; targets (sh\:targetClass, sh\:target); constraints*                | **Claim scope** (targets define **where** constraints apply); **F≥4** (predicate form)   | SHACL “target” ≈ **membership predicate** on a dataset context; perfect analogue of **Claim scope** on data slices; constraint language supports **F4**‑style predicates.                     |
|  6 | OWL 2 practice     | *Class extension; domain/range; imports/version IRI*                        | **Claim scope** as class extension over an ontology context                              | Class extension is set‑semantics by design; **G** naturally maps to extension over a versioned ontology (part of **ContextSlice**).                                                           |
|  7 | IETF BCP 14        | *MUST/SHALL/SHOULD; requirements language*                                  | **Guard style** (observable predicates)                                                  | BCP 14 doesn’t define scope but dictates how guards are worded; USM aligns by requiring **observable, deterministic** membership checks.                                                      |
|  8 | DO‑178C / DO‑333   | *Operational conditions; DAL; formal method objectives; TQL*                | **Work scope** (operating conditions); **F** (proof‑grade), **R** (assurance objectives) | Operational applicability = **Work scope**; formal method objectives lift **F**; Tool qualification impacts **TA/R**, not G.                                                                  |
|  9 | ISO 26262          | *Operational situation & operating modes; ASIL; OSED*                       | **Work scope** (operating modes/situations)                                              | OSED/operating modes define **where capability can be exercised** → **Work scope**. Assurance level (ASIL) relates to **R**, not G.                                                           |
| 10 | IEC 61508          | *SIL; demand mode; proof test interval*                                     | **Work scope** (demand vs continuous mode) + **R freshness**                             | Mode concepts influence **where/how** a function can be claimed → **Work scope**; proof test interval sits in **R** (freshness/decay).                                                        |
| 11 | ACM Artifacts      | *Available/Evaluated/Reusable; Reproduced/Replicated*                       | **R** signals; **ContextSlice** (reproduction environment)                               | Badges encode **evidence availability/strength**; the declared environment maps to a **slice**; scope of claim is often implicit → USM makes it explicit.                                     |
| 12 | SRE / Cloud SLO    | *SLOs; error budgets; regions/tiers; rollout windows*                       | **Work scope** (regions/tiers/windows) + **measures**; **Γ\_time** policies              | SLOs attach **measures** within a **Work scope** (region/tier/time window); perfect fit for USM Method–Work guards (WG‑1..3).                                                                 |

**Summary.** Across all Contexts, two stable notions recur: (1) **evaluate in a concrete context** (→ `U.ContextSlice`), and (2) **declare where something holds/is deliverable** (→ set‑valued **Scope**). “Context of use,” “operating modes,” “targets,” “class extension,” and “OSED” are all Context‑flavored presentations of **Claim scope** or **Work scope**. Terms like *validity* and *operation* are semantically close but collide with **LA** and FPF’s **Work/Run** lexicon; we therefore **do not** adopt them as characteristic names.
### F.18 Term Selection — Unified Tech & Plain names

#### Selected names (normative)

| Concept in A.2.6                | **Unified Tech** (lexicon)                      | **Unified Plain** (manager‑friendly) | Allowed short form   | Deprecated / avoid                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addressable evaluation context  | **`U.ContextSlice`**                            | **Context slice**                    | *Slice* (when local) | “domain” (as guard input), “latest” time                              |
| Abstract mechanism (set‑valued) | **`U.Scope`**                                   | **Scope**                            | —                    | “applicability”, “envelope”, “validity” (as characteristic names)     |
| Episteme applicability          | **`U.ClaimScope`** (*nick **G**)               | **Claim scope**                      | **G**                | “generality”, “applicability/envelope (of claim)”                     |
| Capability applicability        | **`U.WorkScope`**                               | **Work scope**                       | “capability envelope”, “operational applicability”, “operation scope” |
| Time selector                   | **`Γ_time`**                                    | **Time selector**                    | —                    | implicit “latest”                                                     |
| Cross‑context mapping              | **Bridge + CL**                                 | **Bridge + congruence level**        | **CL**               | silent reuse across Contexts                                             |
| Parallel coverage               | **SpanUnion**                                   | **Union of supported areas**         | —                    | unqualified “union” without independence                              |
| Serial dependency               | **Intersection**                                | **Intersection of scopes**           | —                    | ordinal “more/less general” language                                  |
| Scope edits                     | **ΔG+ (widen), ΔG− (narrow), Refit, Translate** | **Widen, narrow, refit, translate**  | —                    | stealth widening (“it’s obvious”)                                     |
| Optional didactics              | **`U.Detail (D)`, `U.AbstractionTier (AT)`**    | **Detail / abstraction tier**        | **D / AT**           | using AT/D as G substitutes                                           |

**Why these names (decision grounds):**

* **“Scope” wins over “envelope/applicability/validity”.** It is short, **self‑documenting**, and already idiomatic in SRE/SW, while “validity” clashes with **Validation Assurance (LA)** and “envelope” suggests geometry, not **membership**.
* **“Claim scope” vs “Work scope”.** Two‑word compounds meet the FPF clarity rule: the first token reveals the **carrier** (Claim vs Work/Capability), the second the **mechanism** (scope).
* **Keep **G**.** The F–G–R triple is canonical; we retain **G** as nickname for **Claim scope**.
* **“Context slice”** is the only term that makes the evaluation target **addressable** (Context, versions, params, **Γ\_time**).
* **“Operation/operating/validity” avoided.** They are **overloaded** in existing FPF lanes (Work/Run, LA) and create policy ambiguities in guards.
#### Phrasebook (for editors, normative)

* Use **“Claim scope (G) covers TargetSlice”** and **“Work scope covers JobSlice”** in guards.
* Always spell **`Γ_time`**; never say “latest”.
* To compose, say: **“intersection along dependency paths; SpanUnion across independent support lines.”**
* For Cross‑context use, say: **“via Bridge; CL penalties apply to R (trust), not to F/G (content/scope).”**
* When widening/narrowing, write **“ΔG+ / ΔG−”** and log the support change; use **“Refit”** for unit/param normalization.
#### Rosetta summary (informative, for rationale box)

| local context phrase                          | Use in USM wording                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Context of use” (NIST, ASME/FDA)          | **Claim scope (G)** on explicit **Context slice**           |
| “Operating modes/situations” (ISO 26262)   | **Work scope** with measures & qualification windows             |
| “Target (class/shape)” (SHACL/OWL)         | **Claim scope predicates** (membership)                     |
| “Architecture view context” (42010)        | **Context slice** + **Scope** checks inside the view        |
| “Capability envelope” (legacy safety docs) | **Work scope**                                              |
| “Domain” (informal)                        | **Context slice** elements; not acceptable as a guard input |


**Outcome.** The UTS shows strong convergence across SoTA Contexts on **addressable context** and **set‑valued applicability**. F.18 therefore fixes: **Context slice**, **Scope**, **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Publication scope** with the algebra and guard clauses mandated in A.2.6. This closes synonym drift while remaining readable for engineering managers and precise for assurance tooling.
