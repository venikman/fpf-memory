# Unified Selection Kernel (SelectorMechanism)
> Pattern `A.19.SelectorMechanism` · Stable · Architectural (A) · Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

> **Type:** Architectural (A)
> **Status:** Stable
> **Normativity:** Normative (unless explicitly marked informative)
> **Placement:** Part A / CN‑Spec cluster (A.19) / CHR mechanism owner patterns (Phase‑3)
> **Source:** FPF / CHR Phase‑3 mechanism owner patterns
> **Modified:** 2026‑01‑20
>
> **Semantic owner note (Phase‑3 canonicalization):** this pattern is the **designated single semantic owner** of the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `SelectorMechanism.IntensionRef` (CHR suite stage `select`). This matches the “single‑owner route map” discipline (`E.20:4.2`): mechanism‑intension semantics live in an explicitly designated mechanism‑owner pattern.
> `A.6.1` remains the owner of the **template** of `U.Mechanism.Intension` and the `U.MechAuthoring` discipline; this pattern owns the **SelectorMechanism‑specific** slots/ops/laws/admissibility/applicability/transport/plane/time/audit obligations for that template (single‑owner at the instance‑semantics level).
>
> **ID continuity note.** When migrating away from any legacy “card location”, preserve public anchors: keep the legacy section heading/ID as a **Tell + Cite stub** (or dock aliases via `F.18`) rather than deleting or silently renaming it.
>
> **Canonicalization hook (ID‑continuity‑safe):** any other appearances of the SelectorMechanism intension content (e.g., a legacy grounding stub in `A.6.1` or suite prose in `A.19.CHR`) SHALL be reduced to a **Tell + Cite** stub pointing to **`A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1`**, while preserving the original section headings and their public `PatternId:SectionPath` IDs for continuity (alias‑dock legacy tokens rather than deleting them).
> Such stubs MUST NOT restate SlotIndex / OperationAlgebra / LawSet / Admissibility / Audit content (no “second center of gravity” via near‑duplicate prose).
> * **ID‑continuity‑safe:** if content is moved from an earlier location, preserve the earlier heading and its IDs as a stub that cites `A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1`.
> * **Alias‑dock, don’t break:** if any legacy tokens exist (e.g., a historical `UNSELM` name token), dock them via `F.18` + E.10 rules; do not mint a competing head.
> * **No shadow semantics:** derived summaries MAY be informative, but MUST NOT restate SlotIndex / OperationAlgebra / LawSet / Admissibility / Audit; they may only summarise and cite.

* **What it is:** a universal **set‑returning** selection kernel: it takes candidates, lawful comparison outcomes, and explicit criteria, and returns a **portfolio set**, not a forced single winner.
* **What it is not:** it is not a hidden scoring model, not a comparator, not a gate, and not a telemetry or publishing step.
* **Why it exists:** to prevent three recurring failure modes: **hidden thresholds**, **silent scalarization**, and **winner‑take‑all defaults** under partial orders and uncertain evidence.
* **How it evolves:** method semantics and SoTA algorithm families connect via `G.2` packs and wiring modules; the kernel signature stays stable and teachable.
* **Suite stage:** `select` (ordering lives only in `A.19.CHR:4.5` / `suite_protocols`; suite membership is a set in `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
* **Inputs (conceptual):** `CandidateSetSlot` + `ComparisonResultSlot` (lawful relation/poset tokens, typically produced by `CPM`) + `CriteriaSlot` + `CNSpecSlot` + `CGSpecSlot` + `ContextSlot` (+ `TaskSignatureSlot?`, + `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` override).
* **Output (conceptual):** `SelectionSlot` = portfolio set (a singleton is allowed **only** when explicitly demanded by criteria or by an explicitly declared upstream total order).
* **Non‑goals:** does **not** normalize (UNM), indicatorize (UINDM), score (USCM), fold (ULSAM), compare (CPM), define acceptance thresholds, publish, or emit telemetry; it is a selection step over already‑lawful inputs.
* **P2W seam:** concrete edition/policy pin bindings (e.g., `TaskSignatureRef@edition(…)`, `CGSpecRef@edition(…)`, evidence overrides) are chosen in planned baseline artefacts (`A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2`); executions only record effective refs/pins in `Audit`.
* **TGA use:** when used as a node type in `E.18 (E.TGA)`, selector instances are chosen in planned baseline artefacts (P2W); this pattern owns the intension that those instances cite.
* **Failure mode:** tri‑state guard (`pass|degrade|abstain`); missing/unknown evidence never coerces to `pass`.
* **Mental model:** `SelectEligibility` gates the step; `Select` applies explicit criteria to set‑valued comparison outcomes; the result is a portfolio set whose “single winner” behavior must be explicit.

## Problem frame

FPF’s Characterization (CHR) suite treats selection as a **distinct mechanism boundary** within the suite (authoritative membership: `A.19.CHR:4.2`).
Suite membership is a **set**; order has no semantics. Any intended ordering is expressed only via `suite_protocols` (`A.19.CHR:4.5`), under suite obligations (`A.19.CHR:4.3`).

Within the suite‑closed protocol, `SelectorMechanism` appears as the `select` stage (after lawful comparison; optional stages remain explicitly optional per `suite_protocols`). The kernel’s role is concept‑level and contract‑bound:

* consume **lawful** comparison outcomes without collapsing them into a hidden scalar,
* apply **explicit** criteria and policy routing, and
* return a **set/portfolio** result whose defaults are policy‑bound and auditable.

The kernel uses the CHR suite SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`) to prevent SlotKind drift across specializations and across SoTA wiring layers.

---
## Problem

Engineering teams regularly need to make “a selection decision” under conditions that are normal in real projects:

* comparisons are partial, multi‑criteria, or set‑valued,
* evidence is incomplete or policy‑gated, and
* different stakeholders ask for different “best” notions.

If selection is not a first‑class mechanism boundary with stable semantics, the same high‑risk drift happens repeatedly:

* **Silent winner forcing:** partial orders get collapsed to a single winner by ad‑hoc tie‑breakers or hidden weights.
* **Hidden thresholds and constants:** thresholds, weights, dominance regimes, and “default portfolio modes” get smuggled into implementations and become invisible in discussion and audit.
* **Scalarization by convenience:** set‑valued comparison outcomes get replaced by a scalar “score summary” that is treated as decision‑relevant without being declared as such.
* **Evidence coercion:** missing or unknown evidence gets treated as “good enough” (implicit pass) rather than routing to explicit `degrade` or `abstain`.
* **Boundary erosion:** selection quietly performs comparison, scoring, aggregation, or publishing, making the CHR pipeline opaque and hard to reason about.

---
## Forces

1. **Set‑valued reality vs single‑winner convenience.** Many lawful comparisons are partial orders. The kernel must preserve set‑valued semantics while still allowing single‑winner outcomes when explicitly requested by criteria.

2. **Policy primacy vs method freedom.** Criteria and defaults must be explicit and policy‑bound, while multiple method families and decision styles must remain add‑able without mutating the kernel.

3. **No hidden thresholds vs usability pressure.** Engineers often want “just pick one.” If the spec does not constrain this, hidden thresholds and tie‑breakers become de facto policy.

4. **Evidence discipline vs delivery pressure.** Under uncertainty, teams default to coercion (unknown → pass). The kernel must enforce tri‑state eligibility and fail‑closed discipline.

5. **Auditability vs conceptual minimalism.** FPF stays conceptual. Audit obligations must be minimal yet decisive: editions and effective policy routing must be visible without introducing tool‑level governance.

6. **Evolvability vs didactic usability.** The kernel must be stable enough to support SoTA wiring and specialization ladders, but also teachable: one place to learn the boundary, laws, guard behavior, and audit minimum.

7. **P2W separation and gate/guard separation.** Planned binding of fillers and pins lives in WorkPlanning (P2W). Selection must not mutate into a gate pattern: no `GateDecision` or decision logs inside the mechanism boundary.

8. **No competing defaults.** If defaults exist (for portfolio mode, dominance regime, archive policies), they must be cited from their declared single sources, not replicated or re‑declared inside the kernel (`A.19.CHR:4.3.5`).

---
## Solution

`SelectorMechanism` is the canonical **selection kernel** for CHR and for selector specializations. It provides:

* a stable mechanism boundary for `select`,
* a stable SlotKind surface (via the CHR lexicon),
* a minimum law set that preserves set‑valued semantics and forbids hidden thresholds and hidden scalarization,
* a tri‑state admissibility guard that is fail‑closed under missing legality or evidence,
* an audit minimum that records effective editions and policy routing.

Method semantics and SoTA algorithm families do not live inside the kernel: they connect via `G.2` SoTA packs and wiring modules, and via lawful specializations `⊑/⊑⁺` that obey the ladder discipline (`A.6.1:4.2.1`).

### Mechanism.Intension — normative core

Archetypal Grounding — **Mechanism.Intension** (normative).

* **Scope note:** this intension is an **instance** authored to the `U.Mechanism.Intension` shape owned by `A.6.1`. It defines only the mechanism’s semantic surface (slots/ops/laws/guards/audit). It does **not** bind project‑specific pins (P2W), and it does **not** emit GateDecision/GateLog; it emits `Audit` pins and a tri‑state guard only.
* **Canonicality note:** this is the canonical `U.Mechanism.Intension` for `SelectorMechanism.IntensionRef` and is intended to be cited by CHR suite artefacts and by any wiring layers; other mentions are **Tell + Cite** only.

* **IntensionHeader:** `id = SelectorMechanism`, `version = 1.0.0`, `status = stable`.

* **IntensionRef:** `SelectorMechanism.IntensionRef` (canonical target for the suite member named in `A.19.CHR:4.2`).

* **Tell.** Universal set‑returning selection kernel over candidates and criteria; defaults remain policy‑bound; **no hidden thresholds**.

* **Purpose:** universal set‑returning selection kernel over candidates and criteria; defaults remain policy‑bound; **no hidden thresholds**.

* **Imports:** `A.6.1:4.2.1 (multi-level specialisation ladders)`, `A.6.5 (slot discipline; SlotIndex as projection)`, `A.19.CN (CN‑Spec governance card)`, `C.22 (TaskSignature as a policy routing surface when used)`, `G.5 (selector conformance and default routing)`, `G.0 (CG‑Spec legality and evidence gates)`, `A.19.CHR:4.2.1 (CHR SlotKind Lexicon)`.

* **SubjectBlock:**

  * **SubjectKind:** `Selection`.
  * **BaseType:** `U.Set (candidates) + U.RelationTokenSet (lawful comparison outcomes)`.
  * **SliceSet:** `U.ContextSliceSet`.
  * **ExtentRule:** selection ranges over admitted candidates in the active context slice, constrained by explicit criteria/policies and by lawful comparison outcomes.
  * **ResultKind?:** `U.Set`.

* **SlotIndex:** derived projection from `SlotSpecs` (and any guard‑only SlotSpecs) per slot discipline; uses `A.19.CHR:4.2.1` SlotKind tokens; has no independent semantics.

  * `CandidateSetSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (candidates), refMode = ByValue⟩`.
  * `ComparisonResultSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (relation/poset tokens), refMode = ByValue⟩`.
  * `CriteriaSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (selection criteria / clauses, incl. explicit tie‑breakers; **acceptance thresholds are not criteria** and remain owned by the cited acceptance surfaces and applied only via `SelectEligibility`), refMode = ByValue⟩`.
  * `TaskSignatureSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = TaskSignature, refMode = TaskSignatureRef⟩` optional; when present, SHOULD be the single routing surface for selector defaults (e.g., portfolio mode / dominance regime), but it does not replace `CNSpecSlot` / `CGSpecSlot` contract surfaces.
  * `CNSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CN‑Spec, refMode = CNSpecRef⟩`.
  * `CGSpecSlot : ⟨ValueKind = CG‑Spec, refMode = CGSpecRef⟩`.
  * `ContextSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.BoundedContext, refMode = U.BoundedContextRef⟩`.
  * `MinimalEvidenceSlot? : ⟨ValueKind = MinimalEvidence, refMode = MinimalEvidenceRef⟩` optional override; otherwise the effective evidence policy is `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`.
  * `SelectionSlot : ⟨ValueKind = U.Set (portfolio), refMode = ByValue⟩`.

* **OperationAlgebra** suite stage = `select`, per `A.19.CHR:4.5`; canonical stage op = `Select`

  * `Select(CandidateSetSlot, ComparisonResultSlot, CriteriaSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ContextSlot, TaskSignatureSlot?, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → SelectionSlot`.

* **LawSet** (minimum): the selection kernel is set‑returning and policy‑bound

  1. **Set‑returning by default:** a conformant `Select` MUST return a set/portfolio by default. It MUST NOT silently collapse partial orders or incomparabilities to a single winner; if a singleton outcome is required, it MUST be an explicit criterion (or a declared upstream total order).
  2. **No hidden thresholds/constants:** a conformant publication MUST NOT smuggle thresholds, weights, dominance rules, or tie‑breakers. Selection‑level commitments MUST be explicit in `CriteriaSlot` and/or in explicit policy routing surfaced by `TaskSignatureSlot`. Admissibility/acceptance thresholds are applied only via `SelectEligibility` using `CNSpecSlot.acceptance` and the effective evidence policy (`MinimalEvidenceSlot?` or `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`).
  3. **No hidden scalarization:** a conformant publication MUST consume `ComparisonResultSlot` as set‑valued/partial when it is set‑valued/partial. Scalar summaries (if produced at all) are report‑only unless explicitly promoted by policy outside suite closure.
  4. **Evidence gating is explicit:** when selection depends on evidence, it MUST cite either `MinimalEvidenceSlot` (override) or the effective policy `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`, and it MUST route the operation through tri‑state guards (no unknown coercion). Any candidate‑level ineligibility handling MUST be explicit (criteria and/or upstream outputs) and auditable (no silent dropping); the kernel MUST NOT invent new evidence thresholds.
  5. **No competing defaults:** portfolio/dominance defaults (when relevant) MUST be sourced from their declared single owners (typically via `TaskSignatureSlot` routing and/or the selector conformance/default surfaces in `G.5`), and MUST NOT be re‑declared inside the kernel.

* **AdmissibilityConditions** (tri‑state guard; fail‑closed on missing legality or evidence)

  * `SelectEligibility(CandidateSetSlot, ComparisonResultSlot, CriteriaSlot, CNSpecSlot, CGSpecSlot, ContextSlot, TaskSignatureSlot?, MinimalEvidenceSlot?) → GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`.
  * `pass` requires at minimum: (i) `ComparisonResultSlot` is compatible with `CandidateSetSlot` (same candidate universe), (ii) all selection criteria and any tie‑breakers are explicit (via `CriteriaSlot` and/or `TaskSignatureSlot`), (iii) admissibility/acceptance gates (`CNSpecSlot.acceptance`, evidence) do not fail, and (iv) `CNSpecSlot` and `CGSpecSlot` are coherent for the comparison tokens being consumed (no mixed CN-Spec/CG-Spec pairings).
  * If `MinimalEvidenceSlot` is absent, `SelectEligibility` MUST evaluate evidence against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` by explicit rule, and missing/unknown evidence MUST NOT yield `pass`.
  * `degrade` is permitted only when an explicit, auditable failure behavior exists (policy‑bound), e.g., “exclude ineligible candidates” or “sandbox/probe‑only”; `abstain` is used when selection cannot proceed lawfully under the declared criteria/policies.

* **Applicability:**

  * Intended as the last stage of CHR selection after lawful comparison, producing a portfolio‑valued result.
  * Cross‑context selection is allowed only via explicit Transport (Bridge+CL/ReferencePlane) and cannot bypass CG‑Spec legality.

* **Transport:** declarative‑only: no embedded CL/Φ/Ψ tables and no new transport edges; crossings are via cited Bridge+CL/ReferencePlane surfaces; penalties route to **`R_eff` only**.

* **Γ_timePolicy:** `point` by default, no implicit latest.

* **PlaneRegime:** declarative‑only; does not introduce plane crossings. If selection spans planes, it MUST cite the applicable **ReferencePlane** and **CL^plane** policy; penalties route to **`R_eff` only**.

* **Audit:**

  * Must record: `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`.
  * If `TaskSignatureSlot?` is present, must record `TaskSignatureRef.edition`.
  * If `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is present, must record `MinimalEvidenceRef`; otherwise must cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence` as the effective evidence policy.
  * SHOULD record: the realized `GuardDecision` (`pass|degrade|abstain`) and, when non‑`pass`, the policy‑bound failure behavior reference that justified it.
  * SHOULD record: a stable identity for `CandidateSetSlot` and `ComparisonResultSlot` **or** a citable upstream `Audit` anchor that already fixes these identities; the goal is traceability without duplicating upstream semantics.
  * MUST record: a stable identity for `SelectionSlot`.
  * SHOULD record: a stable description (or citable reference) for the effective selection criteria surface (e.g., criteria artefact ids when criteria are reference‑backed; `TaskSignatureRef` when used).
  * SHOULD record: the realized routing‑relevant selector defaults (e.g., portfolio mode / dominance regime) **when** they are not fully determined by a referenced `TaskSignatureRef` or an explicit CAL policy surface; the point is auditability, not re‑declaring defaults.
  * SHOULD record: any Bridge/CL/ReferencePlane ids when `Transport` was invoked.
### Boundary and layering rules

1. **Selection consumes upstream CHR products, it does not invent them.** `ComparisonResultSlot` is an input: the kernel MUST NOT perform normalization (UNM), indicatorization (UINDM), scoring (USCM), folding (ULSAM), or comparison (CPM) inside `Select`. If a scalar “overall score” is desired, it must be declared upstream as a lawful scoring and/or comparator choice, not invented inside selection.

2. **Threshold discipline (acceptance ≠ selection).** Acceptance/admission thresholds are not selection criteria: they live in `AcceptanceClauses` / `TaskSignature` / `GateProfile` surfaces per `A.19.CHR:4.3.5` and are applied only via `SelectEligibility`. Selection‑level tie‑breakers and portfolio constraints MAY exist, but MUST be explicit and auditable (typically as criteria artefacts or explicit policy routing), never as unnamed constants.

3. **Report‑only summaries inside suite closure.** Any scalar summaries, illumination metrics, or auxiliary “why not chosen” telemetry are report‑only unless explicitly promoted by policy, and MUST NOT be used as hidden dominance rules (`A.19.CHR:4.3.3`).
   Publishing and telemetry remain outside suite closure and are routed via established publication surfaces (e.g., `G.10` and/or `PTM`), not as hidden tails inside selection.

4. **Specializations are explicit and disciplined.** Any refinement or extension of `SelectorMechanism` must follow `A.6.1:4.2.1`:

   * SlotKind invariance for inherited operations,
   * no new mandatory inputs to inherited `Select`,
   * added capabilities appear as new operations or as `⊑⁺` extensions.

5. **P2W seam is preserved.** Planned bindings for `TaskSignatureRef@edition`, `CGSpecRef@edition`, evidence policy overrides, and other pins live in WorkPlanning (P2W). Execution visibility is via `Audit`, not by mutating plan objects at run time.

## Archetypal Grounding — informative

### Tell

When comparisons are partial or set‑valued, selection must not pretend there is a single “best” by default. `SelectorMechanism` makes selection explicit, policy‑bound, and auditable: it returns a **set** unless criteria explicitly demand otherwise.
### Show, U.System example

**Scenario.** A platform team must pick a set of deployment options for a subsystem under multiple criteria: latency, cost, and regulatory risk. Comparisons are multi‑criteria and do not induce a total order.

* `CandidateSetSlot` = `{OptionA, OptionB, OptionC}`
* `ComparisonResultSlot` includes tokens such as:

  * `OptionA ≼ OptionB` on latency,
  * `OptionB ≼ OptionA` on cost,
  * `OptionC` incomparable with both on risk evidence (missing attestations).
* `CriteriaSlot` contains explicit clauses:

  * “return all non‑dominated candidates under ParetoOnly,”
  * “candidates missing required evidence must not pass.”
* `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is absent, so evidence is evaluated against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`.

**Outcome.**

* `SelectEligibility` returns `degrade` (or `abstain`, depending on the declared failure behavior) **because** `OptionC` fails evidence gating; selection excludes `OptionC` under an explicit policy route rather than coercing unknowns.
* `SelectionSlot` returns `{OptionA, OptionB}` as a portfolio set, rather than forcing a single winner.
* `Audit` records `CGSpecRef.edition`, the effective evidence policy, and the stable identity of the selected portfolio.
### Show, U.Episteme example

**Scenario.** A methods group selects a portfolio of analysis methods for a task. Candidates are method family refs. The group wants diversity in the portfolio, but does not want diversity metrics to silently become dominance criteria.

* `CandidateSetSlot` = `{Family1, Family2, Family3, Family4}`
* `ComparisonResultSlot` is produced by lawful comparison on declared indicators and evidence gates.
* `TaskSignatureSlot` is present and is the single routing surface for policy defaults:

  * portfolio mode and dominance regime,
  * budgeting/telemetry hooks (when used).
* `CriteriaSlot` declares that diversity signals are telemetry unless explicitly promoted by policy.

**Outcome.**

* `SelectionSlot` returns a portfolio set; any archive‑style behavior is a specialization and policy choice, not a hidden kernel default.
* `Audit` records `TaskSignatureRef.edition`, enabling reproducibility and post‑hoc explanation without embedding tool tokens into the kernel.

---
## Bias-Annotation — informative

This pattern intentionally biases selection authoring toward explicitness and legality.

* **Governance bias.** Bias toward explicit criteria and policy routing surfaces rather than implicit constants. Risk: perceived overhead. Mitigation: keep criteria artifacts minimal, and centralize defaults via `TaskSignatureSlot` when used.
* **Architecture bias.** Bias toward set‑return semantics and against forced total orders. Risk: consumers may expect a single winner. Mitigation: make single‑winner selection an explicit criterion or a declared comparator outcome, not an implicit kernel behavior.
* **Epistemic bias.** Bias toward fail‑closed evidence handling and against unknown coercion. Risk: more `degrade/abstain` early. Mitigation: improve evidence pins and policy clarity; do not relax the kernel.
* **Practice bias.** Bias against embedding telemetry and publishing into selection. Risk: teams want a one‑stop “select and report.” Mitigation: keep reporting in post‑suite routing patterns and record only minimal audit pins here.
* **Didactic bias.** Bias toward one semantic owner and “Tell + Cite” elsewhere. Risk: refactoring work. Mitigation: the result is a spec that can be read and taught without scavenger hunts.

## Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑0** | **MechAuthoring discipline:** the canonical SelectorMechanism `Mechanism.Intension` in `A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1` MUST satisfy `A.6.1` `U.MechAuthoring` and the relevant `CC‑UM.*` checks; this pattern does not override the `U.Mechanism.Intension` shape. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑1** | **Single owner:** the canonical SelectorMechanism `U.Mechanism.Intension` MUST be owned by `A.19.SelectorMechanism:4.1`. Any other SelectorMechanism “card” text MUST be reduced to Tell+Cite referencing this owner section. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑2** | **Set‑return default:** a conformant `Select` MUST be set‑returning by default; it MUST NOT silently collapse partial orders or incomparabilities to a single winner. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑3** | **No hidden thresholds/constants:** a conformant SelectorMechanism publication MUST NOT smuggle thresholds, weights, dominance rules, tie‑breakers, or default portfolio modes. Selection‑level commitments MUST be explicit in `CriteriaSlot` and/or explicit policy routing (e.g., via `TaskSignatureSlot`). Acceptance thresholds remain owned by `AcceptanceClauses` / `TaskSignature` / `GateProfile` surfaces and MUST be applied only via `SelectEligibility`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑4** | **No hidden scalarization:** if `ComparisonResultSlot` is set‑valued or partial, a conformant publication MUST consume it as such; scalar summaries are report‑only unless explicitly promoted by policy outside suite closure. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑5** | **Evidence gating:** a conformant publication MUST guard selection via `SelectEligibility` with `GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}`; missing/unknown evidence MUST NOT yield `pass`. If `MinimalEvidenceSlot?` is absent, the guard MUST evaluate against `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`. Any candidate‑level filtering triggered by evidence MUST be explicit and auditable, not silent. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑6** | **SlotKind discipline:** SlotKind tokens used in the SelectorMechanism intension MUST come from the CHR SlotKind lexicon (`A.19.CHR:4.2.1`). New SlotKinds require lexicon extension first. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑7** | **Transport discipline:** cross‑context and cross‑plane selection MUST be explicit via Bridge+CL/ReferencePlane; penalties route to `R_eff` only, and crossings MUST be auditable. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑8** | **Audit surface:** Audit MUST record `CNSpecRef.edition`, `CGSpecRef.edition`, and the effective evidence policy (record `MinimalEvidenceRef` when overridden; else cite `CGSpecSlot.MinimalEvidence`); MUST record `TaskSignatureRef.edition` when `TaskSignatureSlot?` is used; and MUST record a stable identity for the resulting `SelectionSlot`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑9** | **P2W separation:** planned baseline artefacts MUST bind editions and policy pins (A.15.3 + CHR P2W hook); these bindings MUST NOT be invented as run-time decisions inside the suite protocol. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑10** | **Specialization ladder discipline:** any `⊑/⊑⁺` specialization of SelectorMechanism MUST satisfy `A.6.1:4.2.1`, especially SlotKind invariance and “no new mandatory inputs” to inherited `Select`. |
| **CC‑A19SelectorMechanism‑11** | **Guard + gate separation:** `SelectorMechanism` MUST NOT publish `GateDecision`/`DecisionLog`; the mechanism‑level guard is `SelectEligibility` returning `GuardDecision := {pass|degrade|abstain}` and follows guard lexeme reservations (`A.19.CHR:4.3.2`). |
| GateDecision leakage         | `Select` emits `GateDecision` or writes a decision log                          | Keep gate decisions in gate patterns; selection uses `SelectEligibility` + `Audit` pins only                                                       |

| Anti-pattern                 | What it looks like                                                              | Remedy                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forced single winner         | `Select` always returns exactly one candidate even under incomparability        | Return a portfolio by default; if single winner is required, make it explicit in `CriteriaSlot` and ensure the induced order is lawful and declared |
| Hidden tie-breakers          | “If incomparable, pick lower cost” without declaring that as policy             | Move tie-breakers into explicit criteria or into declared comparator policies; never embed inside the kernel                                        |
| Scalarization by convenience | Replace set-valued comparison with a scalar “summary score” treated as decisive | Keep summaries report-only unless explicitly declared as lawful comparator outputs                                                                  |
| Unknown coerced to pass      | Missing evidence treated as acceptable                                          | Use tri-state `SelectEligibility`; unknown maps to `degrade` or `abstain`                                                                           |
| Selection does comparison    | Selection stage recomputes scoring or comparison internally                     | Keep comparisons upstream; `SelectorMechanism` consumes `ComparisonResultSlot`                                                                      |
| Publish inside selection     | Selection stage emits publish/telemetry as part of the suite step               | Keep publishing and telemetry outside suite closure; record minimal pins in `Audit`                                                                 |

## Consequences

**Benefits**

* Preserves correctness under partial orders by making set‑valued outcomes first‑class.
* Eliminates a major source of decision drift: hidden thresholds, hidden weights, and silent scalarization.
* Improves auditability and teachability: one owner location for selection semantics and its guards.
* Supports evolvability: new method families and selection styles can be wired without changing the kernel signature.

**Costs / trade-offs**

* Portfolio results can require explicit downstream handling when a single decision is needed.
* Strict evidence discipline increases early `degrade/abstain` until criteria and evidence policies are explicit.
* Teams must invest in explicit criteria artifacts instead of relying on implicit conventions.

## Rationale

Selection is where many systems accidentally convert lawful but nuanced information into an unjustified scalar decision. Making selection a separate, explicit mechanism boundary achieves two things that matter for engineering management:

1. **Technical integrity:** it enforces legality and evidence discipline at the decision boundary without smuggling heuristics.
2. **Organizational clarity:** it makes defaults and thresholds discussable, reviewable, and maintainable as explicit policy surfaces.

The set‑returning default is not a “preference for portfolios”; it is a correctness safeguard when the order is not total. Single‑winner outcomes remain possible, but only by explicit criteria or declared lawful comparators.

## SoTA-Echoing

**SoTA vs popular note.** This section records alignment to post‑2015 evidence‑backed practice. It is not a mandate to use fashionable methods; method semantics stay in SoTA packs (`G.2`) and wiring modules, while this pattern fixes the stable selection boundary.

**Pack note, Phase‑3:** this pattern does not currently cite a SelectorMechanism‑specific `G.2` pack or ClaimSheet. If and when such packs are introduced, they should connect via `CriteriaSlot` and `TaskSignatureSlot` routing, keeping kernel semantics unchanged.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Treat the Pareto set or portfolio as a first-class output under multi-criteria partial orders                   | Quality Diversity as a decision framing, e.g., Pugh et al. 2016; Vassiliades et al. 2018                      | Expressed as set‑return default and explicit portfolio criteria; method details live in specializations and wiring | Adapt           |
| Use archive-based portfolios where diversity is part of the result, but do not silently promote it to dominance | Modern QD and archive practices post‑2015, including map-elites descendants and archive insertion policies    | Expressed as policy‑bound criteria and report‑only telemetry unless explicitly promoted                            | Adapt           |
| Pair environments and methods in open-ended or co-evolutionary settings without breaking kernel semantics       | Open-ended environment-method pairing, e.g., Wang et al. 2019 and successors                                  | Expressed as candidate and criteria structuring plus lawful specializations; kernel unchanged                      | Adapt           |
| Include an explicit abstain or reject option under uncertainty rather than forcing a decision                   | Selective prediction and rejection-option practice, e.g., Geifman and El‑Yaniv 2017; follow-on selective nets | Expressed as tri-state `SelectEligibility` with fail-closed discipline                                             | Adopt           |
| Keep architecture commitments traceable and single-owner                                                        | ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 architecture description discipline                                                   | Expressed as explicit semantic ownership and Tell+Cite stubs elsewhere                                             | Adopt           |

**Notes per row** (1–2 sentences; *why* adopt/adapt/reject):
* **Portfolio-as-output (QD framing):** adopt the *decision framing* (portfolio as a first-class result) while keeping concrete QD/portfolio algorithms out of the kernel; they belong in `G.2` packs and wiring modules, preserving evolvability.
* **Archive portfolios (diversity as result):** adapt archive thinking by keeping diversity/illumination signals report‑only unless an explicit CAL/policy promotes them to dominance; this prevents silent scalarization and preserves single‑owner defaults (typically `G.5`/CAL).
* **Open‑ended environment–method pairing:** keep the kernel unchanged; open‑ended pairing is expressed by shaping candidates/criteria (and, when needed, lawful specializations `⊑/⊑⁺`) with explicit edition pins and transfer/validity rules in planned baseline, not by mutating `Select`.
* **Reject/abstain under uncertainty:** adopt the rejection‑option stance as a tri‑state guard with fail‑closed semantics; explicit abstain is preferable to forced choice under missing legality/evidence.
* **Single‑owner architecture discipline:** adopt single‑owner + Tell‑and‑Cite to keep the spec teachable and reviewable; this directly reduces drift and “second centers of gravity”.

## Relations

* **Builds on**

  * `A.6.1` and `CC‑UM.*` for the mechanism intension shape and specialization ladder discipline.
  * `A.19.CHR` for suite membership, suite protocol closure, SlotKind lexicon, and threshold and default discipline.
  * `G.0` for `CG‑Spec` legality and evidence surfaces.
  * `A.19.CN` for `CN‑Spec` governance card used as an explicit input.
  * `C.22` for `TaskSignature` as a policy routing surface when used.
  * `A.6.5` for slot discipline (SlotIndex as projection; SlotKind invariance).
  * `A.15.3` + `A.19.CHR:4.7.2` for the P2W planned baseline seam for edition/policy pin bindings (cited as seam, not duplicated in Intension).
* **Used by**

  * `A.19.CHR` as the canonical `select` stage in CHR pipelines.
  * `G.5` as the primary conformance and specialization context for selector-based method dispatch and portfolio policies.
  * `E.18 (E.TGA)` when selector instances are used as transduction graph nodes; planned pins live in P2W, effective pins surface via `Audit`.
* **Coordinates with**

  * `CPM` and other lawful comparison stages as producers of `ComparisonResultSlot`.
  * `ULSAM` and other lawful aggregation stages that must remain explicit rather than hidden inside selection.
  * `E.20` single-owner discipline and `F.18` alias docking for Phase‑3 canonicalization and ID continuity.
