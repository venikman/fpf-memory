# KindSignature (+F) & Extension/MemberOf
> Pattern `C.3.2` · Stable
> Part C - Kernel Extension Specifications

> **One‑line summary.** Specifies the **intent and extent** of kinds: (**i**) a **`KindSignature(k)`** (the intensional definition of kind `k`) that **declares its own Formality F**; (**ii**) an **`Extension(k, slice) ⊆ U.EntitySet(slice)`** and the **membership predicate** `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` that are **deterministic per `U.ContextSlice`**; (**iii**) **monotonicity** of extension under `SubkindOf`; (**iv**) a **definedness policy** that fails **closed** outside its domain. **Kinds still carry no Scope** (that rule lives in C.3.1); Scope stays on **claims/capabilities** (USM). This pattern gives managers and reviewers the **observable basis** to check “what counts as a member here and now” without entangling applicability (G) or assurance (R).

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3.2**.
**Audience.** Engineering managers, architects, assurance leads, editors.

**Depends on.**

* **C.3.1** (*U.Kind & SubkindOf Core*): kinds are context‑local; `⊑` is a partial order; kinds carry **no Scope**.
* **A.2.6 USM** (*Context slices & Scopes*): Claim scope (G) and Work scope live on claims/capabilities; algebra `∈` (membership), `∩` (intersection), `SpanUnion` (union across independent lines), `translate` (scope mapping).
* **C.2.3 U.Formality (F)**: ordinal F0…F9; no arithmetic; weakest‑link composition applies to content that depends on the signature.
* **C.2.2 F–G–R**: assurance calculus; CL penalties feed **R**, not **F/G**.
* **Part B (Scope Bridges & CL).** CL (scope congruence) and scope translation live in Part B/USM; **kind‑congruence `CL^k`** and kind mapping live in **C.3.3** (KindBridge).

**Non‑goals.**

* No Scope semantics here (USM); no bridge semantics here (C.3.3).
* No repository/notation mandates; this is concept‑level, not tooling.

This pattern makes **describedEntity testable** in a Context:

## Content

## Purpose & Audience

This pattern makes **describedEntity testable** in a Context:

* Authors get a place to write **what defines a kind** (`KindSignature`) and at **what rigor (F)**.
* Reviewers can ask **deterministic** questions: *“Given this `TargetSlice`, which entities are in `k`?”*
* Managers can plan **ΔF** (raise signature rigor) and **ΔR** (evidence over members) **without** changing **G** (applicability).

**No tooling assumption.** The pattern is **conceptual** and notation‑neutral (no OWL/SHACL/type‑system requirement); it specifies reviewer‑checkable obligations that managers can read in plain language.
## Context

Different Contexts encode “type” intent differently (predicates, schemas, ontologies, Standards). Regardless of notation, a team must be able to answer, reproducibly: **who belongs to the kind at this slice?** If this is not stable, claims quantified over the kind are unverifiable, bridges are opaque, and composition becomes unsafe.
## Problem

1. **Ambiguous membership.** Membership depends on tacit “latest” states or unwritten defaults.
2. **Signature opacity.** A kind’s definition is scattered; no single place to declare rigor (**F**) or assumptions.
3. **Order violations.** Subkind hierarchies do not guarantee subset behavior in practice.
4. **Scope leakage.** Teams smuggle applicability (G) into kind definitions, recreating G‑ladders by another name.
## Forces

| Force                              | Tension to resolve                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local freedom vs comparability** | Contexts need their own notations, but membership must be checkable in a common style.                  |
| **Expressivity vs determinism**    | Rich intent is welcome, but membership must be deterministic given `slice`.                          |
| **Intent vs applicability**        | Define “what counts” (intent/extent) without encoding “where valid” (G).                             |
| **Rigor vs cost**                  | Raising signature F has cost; the framework must support low‑F drafts and high‑F safety cores alike. |
## Solution — Objects & Standards (overview)

* **`KindSignature(k)`** — the **intensional** definition of kind `k` in the Context; it **declares `U.Formality`** per C.2.3.
* **`U.EntitySet(slice)`** — the set (or well‑defined universe) of **entities addressable in a given `U.ContextSlice`**.
* **`Extension(k, slice) ⊆ U.EntitySet(slice)`** — **which entities** belong to `k` **at** `slice`.
* **`MemberOf(e, k, slice)`** — membership predicate: `e ∈ Extension(k, slice)`.

**Design split.**

* **Intent** lives in **`KindSignature`** (with F).
* **Extent** is **computed per `slice`** via `MemberOf`.
* **Applicability** (where a **claim** holds) remains a **Scope** on the claim (USM) and **MUST NOT** be encoded into `KindSignature`.
## Norms & Invariants (normative)

> IDs **C3.2‑K‑03…K‑08** correspond to the rules announced in C.3; additional local rules use **C3.2‑S‑\***.

### Signature & Formality

**C3.2‑K‑03 (Signature F).** Every `KindSignature(k)` **SHALL declare `U.Formality`** per C.2.3 (F0…F9).
— *Note:* Raising signature F **does not** automatically raise claim‑level F; claims follow weakest‑link along their **own** support paths.

**C3.2‑K‑04 (Signature change = content change).** Any change to `KindSignature(k)` that **alters membership** (i.e., would change `Extension(k, slice)` for some `slice`) **SHALL** be recorded as a **content change** (Contexts may version kinds).
### Extension & Membership

**C3.2‑K‑05 (Deterministic membership).** For fixed `(k, slice)`, `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` **MUST** be deterministically evaluable **from observable content in `slice`**.
— Implication: **“latest” is forbidden**; `Γ_time` must be explicit on `slice` (A.2.6).
— If a classifier makes external assumptions, they **MUST** be named in `KindSignature`.

**C3.2‑K‑06 (Monotone in `⊑`).** If `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then for **every** `slice`:
`Extension(k₁, slice) ⊆ Extension(k₂, slice)`.

**C3.2‑K‑07 (Definedness & fail‑closed).** Each Context **MAY** restrict the **domain of definedness** for `MemberOf(–, k, –)` (e.g., only when a Standard or dataset is present at a given version). Outside that domain, `MemberOf` **MUST** be treated as **not defined** for guard purposes, and guards **MUST fail closed** (deny). Implementations MAY internally return `False`, but there **MUST** be no path where undefined membership yields implicit success.

**C3.2‑K‑08 (Separation from G).** Guards **SHALL** keep **Scope coverage** (USM) and **membership** **as separate predicates**:
“`U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` **AND** `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is defined/used”.
### Entity set & time

**C3.2‑S‑01 (`U.EntitySet`).** A Context **SHALL** document what counts as `U.EntitySet(slice)` (e.g., “rows in dataset D at version v,” “live objects in service S at build b,” “ontology individuals at vocabulary v”). This documentation **MUST** be stable and addressable via the `slice` tuple.
**C3.2‑S‑02 (Time).** `slice` **SHALL** specify **`Γ_time`** (point/window/policy). Membership **MUST NOT** rely on implicit recency. 

`U.EntitySet(slice)` **MUST NOT** expand implicitly via external defaults or time; its extent is fixed by the `slice` tuple (see **C3.2‑S‑02**).
## Interactions & Placement (informative)

* **With C.3.1.** Kinds carry identity and `⊑`; **no Scope** on kinds. This pattern adds the **intent/extent** layer under those constraints.
* **With A.2.6 (USM).** A typed claim’s guard normally evaluates, in the order specified by **Annex C.3.A §5 (E‑01)**: (1) typed compatibility, (2) **Scope coverage** at `TargetSlice`, (3) **`MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)`** definedness and any instantiation, followed by penalties to **R** and freshness checks. Use **Guard_TypedClaim** / **Guard_TypedJoin** rather than ad‑hoc shapes.
* **With C.2.3 (F).** Signature F influences claims **only if** the claim **depends on** the signature content; weakest‑link min applies along the claim’s support path.
* **With C.3.3 (KindBridge).** When `MemberOf` is computed via a **kind mapping across Contexts**, kind‑congruence `CL^k` contributes a **monotone penalty to **R** only (Ψ(`CL^k`)); **F/G MUST NOT** be adjusted. 
* **With Role‑CAL (C.3.4).** A **RoleMask** may **narrow** membership (context‑local adaptation). Frequent masks that encode stable narrowing **SHOULD** be promoted to subkinds (`⊑`).
## Authoring & Review Guidance (informative)

### Authoring KindSignature

* **Be explicit and observable.** Prefer predicate‑like clauses over prose (“has VIN format …”; “axles ≥ 2”).
* **Bind to versions.** Name Standards/schemas by version; avoid “current.”
* **Declare F honestly.** F3 for controlled narrative is fine in early phases; aim F4+ for durable kinds; consider F7+ for safety‑critical cores.
* **Name assumptions.** If membership requires external conditions (e.g., calibrated rig), put them in the signature.
### Authoring membership

* **Define `U.EntitySet(slice)`.** Write it down once per Context, make it addressable via the `slice` tuple, and reuse.
* **Determinism first.** No hidden IO, no implicit time; membership must be recomputable from the slice.
* **Document definedness.** If `MemberOf` is undefined without a Standard, say so; guards will fail closed.
* **Respect `⊑`.** If you declare `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, verify subset behavior (C3.2‑K‑06).
### Review checklist (10 minutes)

1. Is **signature F** declared? Is the signature sufficient to evaluate membership?
2. Is **`U.EntitySet(slice)`** documented and addressable?
3. Is **membership deterministic** with explicit `Γ_time` (no “latest”)?
4. If `⊑` links exist, does **subset behavior** hold at sample slices?
5. Are **Scope** and **membership** kept **separate** in guards?
6. Any **Cross‑context** classification? If yes, is **KindBridge** referenced (C.3.3)?
## Worked Examples (informative)

### Vehicle (signature F4) and membership

**KindSignature(Vehicle)** *(F4)*:

* `hasVIN(x)` is true and parseable;
* `axles(x) ≥ 2`;
* `hasBrakeSystem(x)`;
* Standards: `registryAPI v1.4`; `Γ_time` policy: rolling 365 d for registry fields.

**`U.EntitySet(slice)`**: “records in `registryAPI v1.4` for plant `A` at build `b`, as of `Γ_time`.”
**`Extension(Vehicle, slice)`**: all records satisfying the predicates **in that `slice`**.
**Monotonicity:** `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle` ⇒ `Extension(PassengerCar, s) ⊆ Extension(Vehicle, s)`.
### AuthenticatedRequest (definedness & fail‑closed)

**KindSignature(AuthenticatedRequest)** *(F4)*:

* `Request` with `authHeader` present and `authSignature` valid according to `AuthStandard v2.3`;
* `Γ_time`: point in time for key validity check.

**Definedness:** `MemberOf(–, AuthenticatedRequest, slice)` is **undefined** if `AuthStandard v2.3` is **absent** in `slice` ⇒ guards **fail closed** (C3.2‑K‑07).
### Clinical cohort (low‑F signature; deterministic membership)

**KindSignature(AdultPatient)** *(F3→F4 as it hardens)*:

* `ageYears(x, Γ_time) ≥ N` (jurisdictional N varies; recorded in the Context’s signature note).
* `EntitySet(slice)`: EHR `ehr‑east v7.5` @ `Γ_time`;
* Membership deterministic if DOB present; undefined otherwise (fail closed).
## Anti‑patterns & Remedies (informative)

| Anti‑pattern                                         | Why it’s wrong                        | Remedy                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using “latest” implicitly in membership              | Non‑deterministic; unreproducible     | Require explicit `Γ_time`; treat freshness separately in **R**      |
| Encoding Scope (“only in EU plant”) in the signature | Confuses applicability with describedEntity | Move such conditions to **Claim scope (G)**; keep signature general |
| Declaring `k₁ ⊑ k₂` but not ensuring subset behavior | Breaks typed reasoning                | Tighten `KindSignature` or drop the `⊑` link                        |
| Treating RoleMask as a different kind                | Catalog sprawl; hidden semantics      | Keep mask as adaptation; promote to subkind if widely reused        |
| Membership relying on external, unnamed assumptions  | Hidden dependencies; review fatigue   | Name assumptions in the signature; point to Standards/versions      |
## Rationale (informative)

### Why give F to KindSignature?

Because rigor in the **definition of a kind** materially affects how safely teams can quantify over it. A signature at **F4** (predicate‑like) makes membership checkable in principle; **F7+** (machine‑checked) can support proof‑carrying development. Keeping this **separate from claim‑level F** prevents “signature formalization” from inflating unrelated claims.
### Why Extension is not Scope

* **Extension** answers: *“Which entities count as `k` **in this slice**?”*
* **Scope (G)** answers: *“In which slices does **this claim** hold?”*
  Blending the two recreates the old failure mode where “more abstract wording” was treated as “wider applicability.” USM already gives the set‑algebra for G; Kind‑CAL supplies the **typed universe** the claim quantifies over.
### Why determinism and fail‑closed?

Guards must be **reproducible** and **auditable**: same `slice` ⇒ same membership result. If inputs are missing (undefinedness), the safest default is **deny** (fail closed), prompting either a richer slice or a scope/claim change.

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C3.2‑K‑03** | Every `KindSignature(k)` **declares `U.Formality`** (F0…F9).                                    |

| **C3.2‑K‑06** | **Monotonicity:** if `k₁ ⊑ k₂` then `Extension(k₁, s) ⊆ Extension(k₂, s)` for all `s`.          |
| **C3.2‑K‑07** | **Definedness:** outside domain, membership **fails closed**; guards deny use.                  |
