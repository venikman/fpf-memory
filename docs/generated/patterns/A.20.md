# U.Flow.ConstraintValidity — Eulerian
> Pattern `A.20` · Stable
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

**Tech‑name.** `U.Flow.ConstraintValidity` (`U.Flow` genus)
**Plain‑name.** Flow constraint validity (Eulerian interpretation)
**Type / Status.** Architectural pattern — **normative** for flows hosted by E.TGA (E.18) under the Eulerian operational interpretation

**One‑liner** Defines cross‑cutting **ConstraintValidity** rules for all `U.Flow` instances. `U.TransductionFlow` inherits these rules and may refine **CV class specializations** for transduction‑specific semantics (species‑binding only; genus rules remain unchanged). The CV core is **kind‑agnostic** and assumes an **open‑world** catalogue of node **species**; the enumeration of node **kinds** in E.TGA is a **minimal roles baseline**.
**Operational interpretation.** **Eulerian** stance: **flow = valuation** over `U.Transfer`; **CV is attached to transformations (steps)** and evaluated **before any GateFit**; edges carry **assurance‑only operations**; no token‑passing semantics are assumed.

## Content

## Intention

**One‑liner** Defines cross‑cutting **ConstraintValidity** rules for all `U.Flow` instances. `U.TransductionFlow` inherits these rules and may refine **CV class specializations** for transduction‑specific semantics (species‑binding only; genus rules remain unchanged). The CV core is **kind‑agnostic** and assumes an **open‑world** catalogue of node **species**; the enumeration of node **kinds** in E.TGA is a **minimal roles baseline**.
**Operational interpretation.** **Eulerian** stance: **flow = valuation** over `U.Transfer`; **CV is attached to transformations (steps)** and evaluated **before any GateFit**; edges carry **assurance‑only operations**; no token‑passing semantics are assumed.
## Problem frame

E.TGA makes *nodes = morphisms* and enforces a *single edge kind* (`U.Transfer`). **GateFit** checks aggregate only in `OperationalGate(profile)` with the activation predicate **CV ⇒ GF**: until aggregated **ConstraintValidity = pass**, all **GateFit** checks return **abstain**. Equivalently, while **ConstraintValidity ≠ pass**, any GateFit‑oriented explanation **does not apply**. To keep flows comparable and auditable, this pattern delimits **internal step constraints** (CV) from **external gate fit** (GF), preventing any second ladder of processes beside the graph.
## Problem

Without a clear CV core:

* internal step laws (domains/ranges, invariants, units coherence, Lipschitz/stability) bleed into gate **profile**;
* plane or comparator declarations sneak into mechanisms;
* freshness and design/run concerns appear inside mechanisms;
* reproducibility suffers because transfers start carrying hidden semantics beyond `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`.

Under this pattern, CV is evaluated **inside** transformations. **If** a check declares planes/units/comparators or depends on an active `GateProfile`, **then** it is treated as **GateFit at gates** and the CV explanation **does not apply**.
## Forces

* **Separation of concerns.** Internal mechanism laws vs. external profile fit.
* **Auditability.** MVPK faces include pins/references only; no new numeric claims; editions and Γ are pinned where applicable.
* **Graph discipline.** One edge kind; all crossings mediated by gates; SquareLaw on every crossing.
* **Reproducible valuation.** Flow = valuation over `U.Transfer`, with slice‑local refresh bounded by sentinels.
* **LEX hygiene.** ASCII Tech labels, twin Tech/Plain registers, registered tokens.
## Solution

### Intent & Scope

**Intent.** Establish the **ConstraintValidity core** for the **`U.Flow` genus**: the normative set of **internal step constraints** and how they are surfaced and aggregated, **independent of GateFit profiles** (publication follows MVPK without adding new numeric claims). Where CV speaks about admissibility, phrase criteria **counterfactually**: *“If the admissibility conditions hold, then the CV explanation applies; otherwise this explanation does not apply.”* Avoid duty verbs unless stating the **normative** CC minima.

**Scope (genus).** CV covers **intra‑step** properties checkable from the transformation’s own signature/mechanism. The canonical CV classes are **genus‑level and non‑exhaustive**:
`MechanismUnitsCoherence`, `LawSetInvariants`, `AdmissibilityConditionsSatisfaction`, `LipschitzBounds`, `TypeDomainRange`, and—only for **`StructuralReinterpretation`**—`ReinterpretationEquivalence` (correspondence/reversibility witness).

**Species binding (`U.TransductionFlow`).** The above classes bind to `U.Transduction(kind ∈ {Signature, Mechanism, Work, Check, StructuralReinterpretation})` with **`OperationalGate = kind=Check`**; no additional CV classes are introduced here (species‑specific semantics reside in A.31 and A.45).

**Out‑of‑scope (CV):** declaring/translating `ReferencePlane/Units/ComparatorSet`; CSLC comparability; Freshness; Role/Channel; Regulated‑X; `DesignRunTagConsistency` — all reside in **GateFit** (A.21).
### Intensional object(s)

**Genus.** `U.Flow` leaves step‑kinds abstract; CV/GF separation applies to any lawful instantiation.
**Species (`U.TransductionFlow`).** `U.Transduction(kind) ∈ {Signature, Mechanism, Work, Check, StructuralReinterpretation}`; this set of **kinds** is a **minimum roles baseline** defined in E.TGA. The **species** space (e.g., `UNM.Authoring/Usage`, `SelectionAndTuning`, `WorkPlanning`, `EvaluatingAndRefreshing`, …) is **open‑world** and non‑exhaustive. `OperationalGate = U.Transduction(kind=Check)`. `StructuralReinterpretation` is **projection‑preserving** (no mutation of `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`) and may retarget **describedEntity** under CC‑TGA‑06‑EX; see also A.45.

**`AdmissibilityConditionsSatisfaction`** — **If** the declared admissibility conditions hold on the step’s inputs and context, **then** the CV explanation **applies**; **otherwise** this explanation **does not apply**.
**`LipschitzBounds`** — **If** inputs vary within the stated domain \(X\) and perturbations/noise \(≤ ε\), **then** the step’s estimate remains within **δ** of the reference; **otherwise** this explanation **does not apply**.
**`MechanismUnitsCoherence / TypeDomainRange`** — **If** units/types/domains match the mechanism’s signature and closed‑world assumptions for the step, **then** the CV explanation **applies**; **otherwise** this explanation **does not apply**.

**Terminology & bindings (normative)**
* **Status/witness lexicon (E.10 discipline).** In CV scope, publications use **Status/Witness** terminology; **GateDecision…** lexemes belong to GateFit (A.21) and do **not** apply to CV.
* **describedEntity = KindBridge.** Any CV mention of “describedEntity” SHALL be read via **`KindBridge (CL^k)`** on **UTS** (A.27 / C.3.3). CV **does not** declare or translate planes/units/comparators.
* **retargeting/witness binding.** For `U.Transduction(kind=StructuralReinterpretation)`, the CV class **`ReinterpretationEquivalence`** SHALL surface **`CV.WitnessRef := ReinterpWitness`** over the addressed `PathSliceId`; the UTS **`SquareLaw‑retargeting` witness** is referenced from MVPK/UTS and **linked** from the CV witness without duplication.
* **`ReinterpWitness` record (normative).**  
  `ReinterpWitness := { PathSliceId, PublicationScopeId, mapping:{kind: iso|optic, laws: PutGet/GetPut}, commutingSquares:[TransferId], definedOn: PathSliceId, properties:{invertible?:bool, idempotent?:bool}, UTS.RowId, NoHiddenScalarization:true }`.
### MVPK Faces (PlainView - TechCard - InteropCard - AssuranceLane)

Minimum pins on faces that surface CV outcomes (**Lean surfacing** allowed by profile but without weakening checks):

* **CtxState pins.** `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` on ports/tokens; raw `U.Transfer` preserves them.
* **Path pins.** `PathId` and `PathSliceId` appear where slice‑local refresh or reinterpretation witnesses are relevant (valuation semantics per A.22).
* **CV pins.** `CV.Status ∈ {abstain, pass, degrade, block}`, `CV.WitnessRef?` (refs only).
* **Edition pins.** If a face cites `CG‑Spec`, `ComparatorSet`, or `UNM.TransportRegistryΦ`, the face **includes** the compatibility surface **as per A.27 (BridgeCard + UTS row, with `CL/CL^plane`)** for downstream consumption. A.20 references this requirement; it does not introduce or modify Bridge/UTS formats.
* **Face scope.** Each face includes `PublicationScopeId` with an **MVPK profile** (Min/Lite/SetReady/Max) — no new surface kinds.
* **Register discipline.** Tech names ASCII; twin labels; required LEX tokens follow E.10 (e.g., `SentinelId`, `PathSliceId`, `SliceRefresh`).

> **No new numeric claims.** Faces add pins and references; they do **not** introduce fresh computed scalars beyond what the mechanism already entails (MVPK functoriality).

**Publication lexeme (per‑check).** Each surfaced CV check is referenced as  
`GateCheckRef := { aspect=ConstraintValidity, kind, edition, scope }` with `scope ∈ {lane|locus|subflow|profile}`. This adds no execution steps and introduces no numeric claims on faces; it records what CV classes were considered and under which editions.
### GateChecks (table) — CV only

**Activation predicate (in E.TGA).** *Until aggregated `CV = pass`, all GateFit checks return `abstain` (CV⇒GF).*
**Role/Channel Fit guard (GateFit scope).** GateFit checks that involve roles SHALL use **Kernel `U.Role` tokens** (domain = `U.System`) and SHALL NOT consume `TypicalEnactorRoleName` strings from alias tables.

CV **must not** declare/translate `Units/ReferencePlane/ComparatorSet`; crossings and CSLC comparability live only in A.21.
### SWP matrix (single‑writer discipline)

* **Writes (faces).** `CV.Status` (and optional `CV.WitnessRef`) only.
* **Reads (ref‑only).** Any `CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet/TransportRegistryΦ` editions (when referenced); UNM remains single writer as per CC‑TGA‑24.
### CtxState & GateCrossing

* **Crossings only at `OperationalGate(profile)`** (plane/unit/context) with a **strict exception** for **`StructuralReinterpretation`**: a **projection‑only retargeting** MAY occur without a gate **iff** `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` is preserved, **KindBridge (`CL^k`)** and a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** are present on MVPK/UTS, and the action is **PathSlice‑local** (`PathSliceId` pinned).
* **Projection vs describedEntity (normative reduction).** “Projection” denotes a change of **MVPK published view** that is point‑wise identity on the intensional transformation; “describedEntity” is the **Kind‑channel** on UTS evidenced by a `CL^k` row. “No unit/plane change” holds iff `P` is equal on both sides and **no `CL^plane`** is emitted for the step.
* **Projection/describedEntity normalization (normative).** In the context of `StructuralReinterpretation`, the terms **projection** and **describedEntity** are read **via UTS**: projection = change of **published view coordinates** only; describedEntity = **Kind‑channel** change under `CL^k`. A **“no unit/plane change”** test SHALL verify that `ReferencePlane(src)=ReferencePlane(tgt)` and `CL^plane` is absent (or `= ⊤`), otherwise the step is a gated crossing.
* **Assurance operations on edges.** `ConstrainTo/CalibrateTo/CiteEvidence/AttributeTo` reside on `U.Transfer` and do **not** alter `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`; plane/unit changes occur only at gates; Φ/`CL^plane` penalties route in **R‑lane**. describedEntity/kind transitions are surfaced as **`KindBridge (CL^k)`** on **UTS** (see A.27 / C.3.3). describedEntity/kind transitions use **KindBridge (`CL^k`)** (A.27/E.TGA); under CC‑TGA‑06‑EX this appears without a gate and remains PathSlice‑local.

**Terminology binding (TGA‑specific, normative)**
* **Status/witness lexicon (E.10 discipline).** In CV scope, publications use **Status/Witness** terminology; **GateDecision…** lexemes belong to GateFit (A.21) and do **not** apply to CV.
* **describedEntity = KindBridge.** Any CV mention of “describedEntity” SHALL be read via **`KindBridge (CL^k)`** on **UTS** (A.27 / C.3.3). CV **does not** declare or translate planes/units/comparators.
* **retargeting/witness binding.** For `U.Transduction(kind=StructuralReinterpretation)`, the CV class **`ReinterpretationEquivalence`** SHALL surface **`CV.WitnessRef := ReinterpWitness`** over the addressed `PathSliceId`; the UTS **`SquareLaw‑retargeting` witness** is referenced from MVPK/UTS and **linked** from the CV witness without duplication.
* **`ReinterpWitness` record (normative).**  
  `ReinterpWitness := { PathSliceId, PublicationScopeId, mapping:{kind: iso|optic, laws: PutGet/GetPut}, commutingSquares:[TransferId], definedOn: PathSliceId, properties:{invertible?:bool, idempotent?:bool}, UTS.RowId, NoHiddenScalarization:true }`.
### SquareLaw

For any gate‑mediated crossing adjacent to CV‑checked steps:
`gate_out ∘ transfer = transfer' ∘ gate_in`.
For **projection retargetings** under `StructuralReinterpretation`, a **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** shows that the **view retargeting commutes** with transfers on the PathSlice. Inconsistencies lead to `degrade`/`block` per active profile (GateFit decision).

**retargeting witness shape (normative, UTS‑level).** A **SquareLaw‑retargeting witness** is an artifact that demonstrates commutativity of a published‑projection retargeting over the addressed **`PathSliceId`**:  
  1) identifies **`PathSliceId`** and **`PublicationScopeId`**;  
  2) presents a **bidirectional view mapping** between projections either as an **iso** or as a **profunctor optic** (`get : A→B`, `put : (B×A)→A`) satisfying **Put‑Get / Get‑Put** laws;  
  3) enumerates the **commuting squares** for the cut‑set edges considered (ids of transfers before/after the retargeting);  
  4) declares properties (**invertible?**, **idempotent?**) and the **definedness area**;  
  5) cites the **UTS.RowId** and links the **DecisionLog** entries that rely on this witness.  
Realizations via **profunctor optics (post‑2017)** are permitted; the optic/lens laws serve as the proof template of commutativity.

**CV witness for reinterpretation (normative, CV‑level).** `CV.ReinterpretationEquivalence` SHALL surface a **ReinterpretationEquivalenceWitness** distinct from the UTS retargeting witness and scoped to the mechanism state over the same **`PathSliceId`**:
  — `PathSliceId`, `PublicationScopeId`, and **definedness region** (domain constraints);  
  — a **pair of internal transformations** (or an optic) with **Put‑Get / Get‑Put** obligations **over mechanism state** (not faces);  
  — a **list of commuting squares** for the **adjacent raw transfers** (before/after reinterpretation) showing SquareLaw at CV boundary;  
  — an explicit **NoHiddenScalarization assertion** (see §4.9) for any comparable return shape;  
  — **edition neutrality**: no new editions are authored; only refs/pins appear.  
This CV witness links to the UTS `SquareLaw‑retargeting` witness when present, but does not duplicate UTS fields.

**CV witness binding (normative).** For the CV class **`ReinterpretationEquivalence`**, the witness **SHALL** be a `ReinterpWitness` record:
`ReinterpWitness := { PathSliceId, PublicationScopeId, mapping: {kind: iso|optic, laws: PutGet/GetPut}, commutingSquares: [TransferId], definedOn: PathSliceId, properties: {invertible?: bool, idempotent?: bool}, UTS.RowId, NoHiddenScalarization: true }`.
The record is **PathSlice‑local** and does not declare or translate planes/units or comparators.
### Sentinel & PathSlice (path‑local refresh)

* Flows are **valuations** over `U.Transfer`, re‑emitting **slice‑locally** under sentinel rules or edition bumps (A.22/A.25). CV contributes to the **prepare/refresh** conditions but does not expand scope beyond the addressed `PathSliceId`.
* **Delimitation & planning (normative).** A `PathSlice` **closes** on: (i) any pinned edition change, (ii) Γ‑window boundary relevant to the face, (iii) `GateProfile` change along the path, or (iv) an explicit sentinel rule. **Concurrency:** at most **one active recompute** per `{PathSliceId}`; parallel recomputes are permitted across **distinct** `PathSliceId`s.
* **CV‑triggered refresh (minimum list).** Re‑emit the addressed `PathSliceId` when any holds: (a) `CV.Status` changes across the lattice; (b) `ReinterpWitness` is added/updated/withdrawn; (c) `AdmissibilityDecl.edition` or `LipschitzBoundRef.edition` changes; (d) updates arrive from A.27 (Bridge) or A.28 (ComparatorSet/UNM.TransportRegistryΦ); (e) error/timeout transitions to a resolved `pass` for a previously `abstain|degrade` CV class.

* **CV‑to‑refresh triggers (normative).** A **SliceRefresh(PathSliceId)** SHALL be scheduled when any of the following occurs:  
  (T1) a **CV status flip** on the slice (`pass↔degrade`, `pass↔block`, or `error/timeout→{degrade|block}` under profile rules);  
  (T2) arrival of a new **ReinterpretationEquivalenceWitness** or a change in its **definedness region**;  
  (T3) updates to adjacent **UTS/Bridge** facts for the slice (e.g., `CL^k`, `BridgeId`, `Φ`/`Ψ` policy‑ids) coming from A.27;  
  (T4) edition changes referenced by CSLC (A.28) on the slice (`ComparatorSetRef.edition`, `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, …);  
  (T5) **FreshnessTicket** lifecycle changes impacting the slice window (A.40);  
  (T6) sentinel rules explicitly attached to the **PathSliceId**.  
Scheduling is **slice‑local**; recompute does not fan‑out beyond the addressed `PathSliceId`.

  **Id‑scheme:** `PathSliceId := PathId × Γ_time selector × ReferencePlane × SentinelFingerprint × IterationCounter`.  
  **Locking for replay:** within a recompute, the effective `E⃗` is **frozen**; outputs carry a **replay fingerprint** resolvable via `DecisionLog`.
### ReturnShape & CSLC (comparability discipline)

When the mechanism yields comparable artifacts, the return surface is **set‑valued / partially ordered**; **no hidden scalarization**. Any comparator citation is **ref‑only** and (if editions are cited) requires `Bridge+UTS` per CSLC (A.28). Actual CSLC checks are GateFit (A.21).

Under **`StructuralReinterpretation`**, **projection changes MUST NOT introduce hidden scalarization**; set‑return semantics remain intact; comparator cites stay ref‑only with UTS discipline.

**Detectable signs of hidden scalarization (normative checklist).** A face **SHALL** be flagged when any holds:  
  (H1) introduction of a **new scalar** not entailed by the mechanism, or any **cardinality‑reducing** fold of a set return (e.g., argmax/best‑of) without a cited **ComparatorSetRef**;  
  (H2) omission of a required **ComparatorSetRef** or its **edition pins** where comparison is implied;  
  (H3) presence of an **order‑imposing coordinate** without a **CoordinatePolicy** and legality annotations (scale/units/illegal ops);  
  (H4) cross‑plane/units numeric combination without a **Bridge+UTS** row;  
  (H5) for `StructuralReinterpretation`, any change of return **plane/units** (violates “projection‑only”).  
Failing (H1–H5) degrades or blocks per GateProfile (§4.4/CC‑TGA‑21a).
### Γ‑windows / Freshness

* No implicit *latest*. Any face expected to be consumed at compare/launch pins `Γ_time`; Freshness enforcement occurs at gates; CV neither issues Freshness tickets nor evaluates staleness (see A.33/A.40).
* **Granularity of Γ (normative).** Γ SHALL be one of: **snapshot** (`effective_at=t`) or **interval** (`[t₀,t₁)` with a named folding policy). Faces SHALL surface which selector is used.  
* **CV time‑stamping.** Each CV computation surfaces `t_cv` and the **Γ selector** it assumed; replay binds `t_cv` to `PathSliceId`.  
* **Temporal policy types (binding).** Γ‑pins refer to the **canonical selectors** of §22 (*`effective_at`*, *`latest_effective_before`*, *`windowed(W, policy)`*) and to **folding policies** that are **IDEM/MONO/WLNK‑safe**. Units/time scales **SHALL** be explicit. Overrides of the default **weakest‑link** fold **SHALL** cite CAL proofs of monotonicity and boundary behavior.
### Unknown/Timeout/Error policy

Each CV class yields `abstain | pass | degrade | block`. Errors/timeouts at CV stage imply **CV ≠ pass**; therefore GateFit abstains by the global activation predicate and any GateFit‑oriented explanation **does not apply**. The **aggregated CV decision** uses the join on `abstain ≤ pass ≤ degrade ≤ block` (neutral = `abstain`; absorbing = `block`).  
**Minimal default (profile‑bound, normative):** **Lean/Core ⇒ `error|timeout → degrade`**, **SafetyCritical/RegulatedX ⇒ `error|timeout → block`**; `unknown` folds per GateCheck policy (safety‑default: `degrade`). (Consistent with **CC‑TGA‑22**.)
### Idempotency / congruence discipline

Any surface influencing gate decisions references **A.41** for **equivalence** of inputs and **idempotency witness**; A.20 does not introduce keys, hashes, or cache policies.
**Minimal lexeme set for CV‑adjacent equivalence (normative).** Where CV outcomes influence a gate decision, the **equivalence witness** SHALL identify at least: `{PathSliceId, GateProfileId, Γ selector (+window bounds if interval), E⃗ editions vector for cited registries, ReturnShape kind (if comparable), CV class/kind set considered}`. Changing any of these breaks equivalence and requires re‑aggregation.
## Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show) ✱

**Show‑1 (compiler build → run).**
A typed module `M` exposes `f : State_d → Artifact_d` under a declared `LawSet` (e.g., determinism under fixed toolchain) and `TypeDomainRange`. **CV** checks: (i) `MechanismUnitsCoherence` (toolchain/flags units coherent), (ii) `LawSetInvariants` (reproducible outputs under same `E⃗`), (iii) `Admissibility` (inputs well‑typed), (iv) optional Lipschitz/stability surrogate (bounded perturbation in sandbox). `CtxState` is preserved along raw transfers. Entering `U.Work(run)` requires `LaunchGate` with `FreshnessUpToDate` and `DesignRunTagConsistency` — **GateFit**, not CV.

**Show‑2 (selection archive in QD/AutoML).**
A mechanism emits a **set** (front/portfolio/archive). **CV** ensures only: valid descriptor ranges, internal metric continuity bounds, archive invariants (idempotent insert). No ranking or acceptance thresholds are introduced at CV; comparators and acceptance policies bind at gates via CSLC and profiles (A.21/A.28). Edition‑aware pins on faces carry `DescriptorMapRef.edition` only with `Bridge+UTS`.

**Anchors.** Algebraic effects & handlers separate signatures from handlers (Koka/Effekt, 2015+); reproducible pipelines isolate mechanism constraints from deployment **profiles** (Bazel/Nix); optics/profunctors and open/hypergraph categories motivate composition on open graphs without adding facts on faces; QD/MAP‑Elites/CMA‑ME/DQD motivate **set‑return + lawful orders** (2015–2022).
## Bias‑Annotation

The pattern constrains *how* internal constraints are surfaced; it does not encode profile‑bound thresholds or Role/Channel fit — those sit in GateFit. This separation reduces leakage of profile concerns into mechanism semantics.
## Conformance Checklist ✱

**Static lint (graph & surfaces)**

* CC‑TGA‑01: only `U.Transfer` edges; crossings appear only on gates.
* CC‑TGA‑05: `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩` unchanged across raw transfers.
* CC‑TGA‑09: MVPK faces present; edition & Γ pins where expected; no new numeric claims on faces (E.17).

**CV discipline**

 * CV classes present exactly as {UnitsCoherence, LawSetInvariants, Admissibility, LipschitzBounds, TypeDomainRange}; **plus** `ReinterpretationEquivalence` when the node kind is `StructuralReinterpretation`. None declare/translate planes/comparators.
 * **Open‑world species.** Any node **species** binds to one of the minimal kinds; adding a new **kind** is out of scope for A.20 and requires an E.TGA update.
* Aggregated **CV.Status** computed; errors/timeouts ⇒ `CV ≠ pass`.

**Gate coupling**

* CC‑TGA‑07: when **CV ≠ pass**, all GateFit checks report **abstain**.
* CC‑TGA‑23: SquareLaw witnesses present on crossings adjacent to CV‑checked steps.
* Any edition citation on faces includes `Bridge+UTS` (A.27; CSLC in A.28).

**UNM single‑writer**

* CC‑TGA‑24: UNM.Authoring is the sole writer for `CG‑Spec/ComparatorSet/TransportRegistryΦ`; CV is ref‑only.

**Valuation & refresh**

* CC‑TGA‑18/19: Flow publishes valuation with `PublicationScopeId`/`PathSliceId`; Γ pinned at compare/launch surfaces; sentinel triggers slice‑local refresh.
## Consequences

**Benefits.**
*Clarity & composability.* Mechanisms remain pure carriers of internal laws; gates are the sole policy junction.
*Replayability.* With valuation + MVPK pins, re‑runs under fixed `E⃗` are comparable and slice‑scoped (A.22/A.25).
*Didactic hygiene.* Readers can see what is mechanism truth vs. gate policy.

**Trade‑offs.**

* Two places to look (CV vs. GF) impose author discipline; mitigated by the activation predicate and MVPK links.
## Rationale

E.TGA hosts A.20 and A.21 as orthogonal cores: CV **inside** transformations; GF **at** gates with join‑aggregation and DecisionLog. This mirrors effects/handlers (signature vs. handler), and reproducible build vs. deployment‑profile separation.
## SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015)

* **Algebraic effects & handlers** (Koka, Effekt): signatures vs. handlers as a model for CV vs. GF.
* **Reproducible pipelines** (Bazel, Nix): hermetic builds ≈ CV; release/deploy gates ≈ GF.
* **Optics/profunctors; open/hypergraph categories** (2017–2019+): composition over open graphs without extra face semantics.
* **Quality‑Diversity / MAP‑Elites / CMA‑ME / DQD (2015–2022):** set‑return with lawful partial orders; no hidden scalarization.
  These anchors justify the separation and the set‑return discipline (CSLC) embedded in the flow family.
## Relations

* **Hosted by E.TGA.** Nodes are morphisms; only `U.Transfer` edges; **open‑world species over a minimal kind set**; CV⇒GF activation; MVPK faces; SquareLaw on crossings; CC‑TGA‑06‑EX for `StructuralReinterpretation`.
* **A.21 (GateProfilization).** Sole point for GateFit checks and profile‑bound folds.
* **A.22 (FlowSpec—valuation).** Declares valuation and slice‑refresh semantics used by this flow family.
* **A.27 (Bridge+UTS).** Boundary‑surface requirement whenever faces cite editions.
* **A.28 (CSLC).** Comparability discipline; CV does not compare; it only ensures internal readiness for lawful comparison.
* **A.41 (DecisionLog & Idempotency).** Equivalence witness binding for any surfaces affecting gate decisions.
* **E.10 (LEX).** Token classes and ASCII Tech names; twin labels and aliasing for Γ/CL/Φ as per LEX‑BUNDLE.

* **MechanismUnitsCoherence.** Internal unit/scale coherence within the step; no declarations or translations of units/planes (GateFit scope).
* **LawSetInvariants.** Mechanism‑declared invariants hold (e.g., mass/energy balance in a model, determinism under fixed editions).
* **AdmissibilityConditionsSatisfaction.** Inputs lie within admissible windows/guards declared by the mechanism’s **AdmissibilityConditions**; failure yields `degrade` or `abstain` per class policy.
  **Minimum declaration (normative):**
  `AdmissibilityDecl := { domains: {name: set/poset}+, guards: [predicate_id]*, windows: {Γ_time: snapshot|interval|policy}, observables: [signal_id]*, edition: EditionId }`.
  The declaration is surfaced on MVPK as references only; it introduces no arithmetic on faces.
* **LipschitzBounds / stability.** Bounded sensitivity to perturbations as declared by mechanism; optional where meaningful.
  **Method binding (normative):**
  `LipschitzBoundRef := { method ∈ {spectral_norm|CROWN|IBP|rand_smoothing|other}, metric_space: {X: norm_id, Y: norm_id}, bound: value_or_interval, units/plane: P, validity_window: Γ_time(basis), edition: EditionId }`.
  The bound is **edition‑pinned** and **plane/units‑declared**; proofs/witness artefacts are referenced (no new numeric claims on faces).
  **Minimal declaration template (normative):**  
  `AdmissibilityConditions := { Domains[]{var, type, range, units, plane}, Guards[]{predicate, editionRefs}, ObservationWindows[]{Γ selector, freshness window}, ObservableSigns[]{name, detection rule}, Editions{… } }`  
  — **No authoring of units/planes** here; only references. — Γ selectors must be explicit.
* **TypeDomainRange.** Type/domain/range compliance of inputs/outputs (ref‑only to definitions).
* **ReinterpretationEquivalence.** Mechanism’s reinterpretation preserves internal meaning on a **PathSlice**.  
  **Witness (normative):** **ReinterpretationEquivalenceWitness** (see §4.7) with: `(i)` `PathSliceId`, `PublicationScopeId`, `(ii)` bidirectional mapping (iso/optic) with Put‑Get/Get‑Put obligations, `(iii)` commuting squares for adjacent raw transfers, `(iv)` **NoHiddenScalarization** assertion (if comparable), `(v)` definedness region.  
  — **No plane/unit change**; any describedEntity change must have `KindBridge (CL^k)` on UTS.
* **LipschitzBounds / stability.** Bounded sensitivity of the mechanism under a declared metric.  
  **Certificate (normative):** `LipschitzCertificate := { metricId (with units/plane), bound L, methodId, methodRef (e.g., spectral estimate / cert. robustness bound), validity region (inputs/state), proof sketch/ref }`.  
  — The **method** MUST be cited; **units/plane** of the metric MUST be explicit; bounds are **ref‑only** at CV; any acceptance action remains GateFit.
* **TypeDomainRange.** Well‑typedness and domain/range consistency for the transformation signature.
  (Enumeration mandated by A.20; GF matters excluded).
* **ReinterpretationEquivalence (StructuralReinterpretation).** Existence of a correspondence/reversibility witness between source and retarget projections; preservation of `⟨L,P,E⃗,D⟩`; no comparator/plane/unit declaration or translation at CV. The witness is **PathSlice‑local** and supports **idempotence & reversibility** within the addressed slice. The normative record is `ReinterpWitness` (see §4.7).

### A.20:Appendix B — LEX discipline (summary)

Register token classes (Tech) include: `U.TransductionFlow`, `U.TransductionGraph`, `OperationalGate`, `GateProfile`, `GateCheckKind`, `GateCheckRef`, `DecisionLog`, `FreshnessTicket`, `FinalizeLaunchValues`, `SubflowRef`, `FlowEmbed`, `SentinelId`, `PathSliceId`, `SliceRefresh`, `VALATA`; discriminators use `Base__P2W`, `Base__EvaluatingAndRefreshing`; Tech names are ASCII; aliases `GammaTimeRule/Plane`, `CLPlane`, `Phi` follow E.10. A.20 references these tokens; it does not introduce additional LEX classes. **For each surfaced CV check, `GateCheckRef.aspect` is fixed to `ConstraintValidity`.** *MVPK minima for CV faces also include `PathId/PathSliceId` where slice‑local refresh applies (A.22).*
