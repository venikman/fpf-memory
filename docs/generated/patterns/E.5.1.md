# DevOps Lexical Firewall
> Pattern `E.5.1` · Stable
> Part E - The FPF Constitution and Authoring Guides

The FPF Core is meant to remain valid across decades and technology
generations.  Implementation details—file formats, build pipelines,
runtime flags—evolve rapidly and differ between domains.  When such
terms invade normative prose, the Core ages as quickly as the tools it
mentions.

## Keywords

- lexical firewall

## Content

## Problem frame

The FPF Core is meant to remain valid across decades and technology
generations.  Implementation details—file formats, build pipelines,
runtime flags—evolve rapidly and differ between domains.  When such
terms invade normative prose, the Core ages as quickly as the tools it
mentions.
## Problem

*Conceptual erosion*: a rule that cites a transient technology becomes
obsolete when that technology fades, forcing unnecessary Core revisions
and fragmenting historical audits.
## Forces

| Force | Tension |
|-------|---------|
| **Timelessness** | Concepts must survive tool turnover. |
| **Pedagogic clarity** | Examples need concreteness ↔ too much concreteness hard‑codes technology. |
| **Cross‑domain reach** | Physical‑system engineers and knowledge‑theorists use different stacks. |
## Solution

Establish a **Lexical Firewall** around the **Conceptual Core** *(conceptual constraint; not a build‑time linter)*:

1. **Forbidden lexicon**  
   Normative patterns **SHALL NOT** contain tool‑or file‑specific words
   (e.g. protocol keywords, file extensions, IDE commands).  
   Permissible wording: “a reference parser”, “a serialisation schema”.

2. **Indirection rule**  
   When a Core concept needs an executable illustration, the pattern
   cites the **Tooling Reference family** artefact by *conceptual name*,
   never by concrete path or syntax.

3. **Glossary pointer**  
   If an unavoidable technical term appears, it is defined in a *Tooling Glossary* outside the Core and referenced by conceptual alias—not embedded.
*Non‑normative automation.* Machine checks **MAY** exist in Tooling; they are advisory and **MUST NOT** be imported into the Core.
## Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

| Scenario | `U.System` example | `U.Episteme` example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Normative text** | “A system boundary must expose at least one conserved‑quantity flow.” (No mention of modelling language.) | “An episteme records its F–G–R assurance tuple.” (No mention of proof syntax.) |
| **Illustrative link** | A modelling profile resides in the Tooling family; Core cites it as “the reference system‑profile”. | A linting routine lives in Tooling; Core cites it as “the reference episteme‑checker”. |
## Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **CC‑LFW.1** | A Core pattern **SHALL** fail review if it contains implementation‑specific tokens. |
| **CC‑LFW.2** | References to executable artefacts **MUST** use conceptual names, not file paths or command strings. |
| **CC‑LFW.3** | Pedagogical examples inside Core **MAY** describe behaviour, but **MUST NOT** embed code snippets. |
## Consequences

| Benefits | Trade‑offs / Mitigations |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Core stays evergreen and cross‑domain. | Authors must relocate concrete examples to Tooling or Pedagogy. |
| Reviewers can machine‑scan for banned tokens. | Requires a small vocabulary allow‑list; maintained in Tooling Guide. |
## Rationale

Language shapes thought.  By firewalling transient jargon, we uphold
**P‑1 Cognitive Elegance** (clarity), **P‑2 Didactic Primacy** (domain‑neutral
exposition) and **P‑5 FPF Layering** (clean separation between Core
and Tooling).  The rule is content‑agnostic and thus itself immune to the
very decay it prevents.
## Relations

* **Parent umbrella:** `pat:constitution/guard‑rails` (E.5)  
* **Constrains:** every pattern in Conceptual Core  
* **Instantiates pillars:** P‑1, P‑2, P‑5
