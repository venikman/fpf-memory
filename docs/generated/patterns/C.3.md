# Kind‑CAL — Kinds, Intent/Extent, and Typed Reasoning
> Pattern `C.3` · Stable
> Part C - Kernel Extension Specifications

> **One‑line summary.** Establishes **`U.Kind`** as the **minimal, context‑local intensional carrier** of “what a statement is about,” separates **intent** (KindSignature + its own **F**) from **extent** (*which* instances belong to the kind **in a given Context slice**), and situates **typed reasoning** alongside **USM Scope (G)** and **F–G–R** without conflation. Details of the core objects and operations live in **C.3.1–C.3.5**; guard shapes are standardized in **C.3.A**.

**Status.** Normative in **Part C**. Identifier **C.3**. This pattern lays the **architectural invariant** and manager‑level guidance. The **mechanics** are defined by its child patterns.

**Readers.** Engineering managers, architects, and assurance leads who must reason about *typed claims* across Contexts without mixing up **describedEntity** (Kinds), **applicability** (**G**), and **assurance** (**R**).

**Depends on.**
— **A.2.6 USM** (Context slices & Scopes): **`U.ClaimScope` = G**, **`U.WorkScope`**, ∈/∩/**SpanUnion**/translate, **Γ\_time** policy, Bridges + **CL** (scope).
— **C.2.2 F–G–R**: weakest‑link composition; penalties to **R** for Cross‑context congruence (CL).
— **C.2.3 Unified Formality F**: F0…F9 as an **ordinal Characteristic** (expression rigor).

**Sub‑patterns (normative unless noted).**
— **C.3.1** - `U.Kind` & `U.SubkindOf` (partial order).
— **C.3.2** - `KindSignature` (**intent**, with **F**) & `Extension/MemberOf` (**extent** in a slice).
— **C.3.3** - **KindBridge** & **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence; penalties route to **R**).
— **C.3.4** - **RoleMask** (context‑local adaptation without cloning kinds).
— **C.3.5** - **KindAT** (K0…K3, **informative facet**, not a Characteristic).
— **C.3.A** - **Typed Guard Macros** (annex): admit/compose, masks, Cross‑context reuse; AT is **forbidden** in guards.

**Deprecations.**
— “**Generality ladder**” for **G**; **G is Scope** only (set‑valued over `U.ContextSlice`).
— Any “**Kind scope**” characteristic (Kinds carry **intent/extent**, not Scope).
— **Mark as legacy** any uses of **‘validity’ as a Characteristic** or **‘operation’ as a Scope‑like Characteristic**; **redirect** to **`U.ClaimScope`** / **`U.WorkScope`** (A.2.6) for applicability. Editors SHOULD add glossary redirects in Part E.

**Editorial note (cut‑over).** Content formerly in C.3 that defined guard shapes, decision trees, and macro anti‑patterns now resides in **C.3.A**. Membership **evaluation obligations** live in **C.3.2** with `MemberOf`.

## Content

## Purpose & Rationale

**What you get.**

1. A **neutral typed layer**: name *what* a claim quantifies over (**Kinds**) without binding to any particular “type technology” (OWL, PL types, shapes…).
2. A clean **split of characteristics**:
   – **Scope (G)** = *where* a claim holds (USM, set‑valued over **Context slices**).
   – **Kind extent** = *which instances* belong to a kind **inside** a given slice.
   – **F** = *how strictly* content is expressed (C.2.3).
   – **R** = *how well supported* (evidence & congruence penalties).
3. **Typed reuse across Contexts**: a dedicated **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence), so you can predict risk **without** touching F or G.
4. **Manager‑oriented maps**: when to invest in **formalization** (F), when to expand/narrow **Scope** (ΔG), when to test across **subkinds** (R), and what kind of **bridge** you should expect.

**Why it helps.**
Teams routinely overspend on proofs for **instance‑level** questions and underspecify scope for **class‑level** claims. By naming the **Kind**, you plan **ΔF/ΔR** correctly and keep **G honest**. Typed checks also block unsafe compositions (“we were talking about different things”).
## Context

Cross‑disciplinary work mixes artifacts that *look like “types”* but behave differently: ontology classes, schema “shapes,” programming types, BORO super/sub categories, ad‑hoc labels. At the same time, **USM** made “scope” precise. What was missing was a *small, neutral* notion of **describedEntity** that (a) **does not** re‑invent a global “type system,” (b) composes with USM and F–G–R, and (c) lets Contexts keep their idioms—**with bridges** when crossing boundaries.
## Problem

1. **Scope–type conflation.** Authors try to widen **G** by “abstracting the wording,” yielding claims that *sound* general but are only supported on a thin slice.
2. **Silent drift across Contexts.** A “vehicle” here is not the same as a “transport unit” there; reuse proceeds without a declared mapping or risk accounting.
3. **Wasteful planning.** Without a signal about the *kind‑level*, teams either over‑formalize single‑slice decisions or under‑test class‑level claims (no variant coverage along subkinds).
4. **Unsafe composition.** Claims about incompatible “things” get composed because the describedEntity was implicit in prose.
## Forces

| Force                             | Tension to resolve                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local freedom vs global sense** | Contexts need their own vocabularies; Cross‑context work needs a common skeleton for **describedEntity**.      |
| **Minimality vs utility**         | The notion of kind must be tiny yet powerful enough to guide ΔF/ΔR/bridges/composition.            |
| **Intent vs extent**              | Kinds come with a **definition** and a **population in place**; both are needed and must not mix.  |
| **Typed discipline vs F–G–R**     | Typed safety must not distort **G** (Scope) nor introduce a parallel “assurance math.”             |
| **Abstraction vs applicability**  | “Higher abstraction” is **not** “wider applicability”; the framework must make this split obvious. |
## Solution — Architectural Decisions (overview)

**C.3‑D1 — `U.Kind` is intensional and context‑local.**
Kinds name *what a claim quantifies over*. They form a partial order **`⊑`** (**SubkindOf**). *(See C.3.1.)*

**C.3‑D2 — Separate **intent** and **extent**.**
— **KindSignature(k)**: the intensional content (predicates/invariants/Standards). It carries its **own F** (C.2.3).
— **Extension(k, slice)**/**MemberOf**: which instances belong to `k` **in a given `U.ContextSlice`**. *(See C.3.2.)*

**C.3‑D3 — Kinds do **not** carry Scope.**
**Scope** lives with **claims/capabilities** (USM): a set of **Context slices** where the statement holds. Kinds carry **intent/extent** only. *(USM A.2.6 + C.3.2.)*

**C.3‑D4 — Typed reuse across Contexts is explicit.**
Use a **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`** (type‑congruence) and loss notes. Its effect is **only via R** penalties; **F/G remain unchanged**. *(See C.3.3.)*

**C.3‑D5 — Local adaptation without cloning.**
Use a **RoleMask** to bind a kind to Context‑specific constraints/aliases; promote to a **subkind** if the mask becomes stable and widely reused. *(See C.3.4.)*

**C.3‑D6 — An **informative** “abstraction tier” exists for Kinds (AT: K0…K3).**
A facet (not a Characteristic) that helps plan **ΔF/ΔR** and forecast bridge style; **AT never appears in guards**. *(See C.3.5.)*

**C.3‑D7 — Guard shapes are standardized and fail‑closed.**
Typed compatibility first (same‑Context **`⊑`** or **KindBridge**), then **Scope coverage** (USM), then **R** penalties and freshness. *(See C.3.A.)*

> **Manager’s picture — Two characteristics (keep them separate).**
> – **characteristic 1 (USM, G):** *Where* the claim holds → set of **Context slices**; composed by ∈ (membership) / ∩ (intersection) / **SpanUnion** (union across independent lines) / translate (scope mapping).
> – **characteristic 2 (Kind extent):** *Which instances* in a **given slice** belong to the kind → `MemberOf(e, k, slice)`.
> **Never “widen G” by abstract wording; widen only by ΔG with support.**
## Core Concepts (informative summary; authoritative norms live in C.3.1–C.3.5)

> This section fixes the **Standard** of terms used in C.3 and points to the sub‑patterns for complete mechanics. All “**SHALL/MUST**” statements here are normative.

**Editorial note.** This section is **informative**. It restates manager‑level takeaways and **points to** the canonical, normative rules in **C.3.1–C.3.5**. Where this section summarizes a rule, treat the cited sub‑pattern (and rule ID) as the **source of truth**.

### U.Kind & U.SubkindOf (⊑)

**Definition.** `U.Kind` is a **context‑local intensional object** naming a “kind of thing” that claims may quantify over.
**Order.** `U.SubkindOf (⊑)` is a **partial order** (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric). We write `k₁ ⊑ k₂`.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.1 K‑01–K‑02**)*.
— Contexts treat `⊑` as a partial order and document any computed meets/joins if they provide them.
— Kinds do not carry Scope; Scope remains on claims/capabilities (USM).

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.1** (definitions, invariants, examples).
### KindSignature (intent) & F

**Definition.** `KindSignature(k)` is the **intent**: predicates/invariants/Standards that define the kind in the Context. Its expression rigor has an explicit **`U.Formality`** (C.2.3).

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.2 K‑03–K‑04**)*.
— `KindSignature(k)` declares its F (C.2.3). Claim‑level F does **not** auto‑inherit; weakest‑link applies on the claim’s own support paths.
— If a signature change alters membership, treat it as a content change (Contexts may version kinds).

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.2** (signature/intent with F; relation to claims).
### Extension & MemberOf (extent in a slice)

**Definition.** `Extension(k, slice) ⊆ EntitySet(slice)` = set of instances that belong to `k` **in the given `U.ContextSlice`**. `MemberOf(e, k, slice)` is the membership predicate: `e ∈ Extension(k, slice)`.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.2 K‑05–K‑08**)*.
— Membership is deterministic for a fixed `(k, slice)` (no hidden “latest”).
— If `k₁ ⊑ k₂`, then `Extension(k₁,slice) ⊆ Extension(k₂,slice)` for all slices.
— Definedness may be bounded; outside it, guards fail closed.
— Keep **Scope (G)** and **MemberOf** as distinct guard predicates.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.2** (extent semantics, examples, authoring hints).
### KindBridge & CL^k (type‑congruence)

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.3 KB‑01–KB‑12**)*.
— A KindBridge states Contexts/versions, kind mapping/rules, preserved order links, **`CL^k`** anchors, loss notes, and definedness.
— No inversions of preserved subkind links; collapses must be declared.
— When classification depends on a KindBridge, apply a monotone penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R** (scope‑bridge **Φ(CL)** applies separately). **F** and **G** remain unchanged.
— Chaining uses weakest‑link on **`CL^k`**.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.3** (bridge shape, anchors, examples).
### RoleMask (adaptation without cloning)

**Definition.** `U.RoleMask(kind, Context)` is a **named binding** that carries constraints (optional **narrowing** of membership), vocabulary/notation aliases, and intended use for local procedures—**without** creating a new Kind.

**Summary of norms** *(authoritative text: **C.3.4 RM‑01–RM‑08**)*.
— Masks are registered/versioned; constraints are observable/deterministic at guard time.
— Do not treat masks as kind synonyms; promote frequently reused constraint masks to explicit subkinds (`⊑`).


> *Full treatment:* **C.3.4** (mask taxonomy, guard discipline, promotion rule).
### KindAT (K0…K3) — informative facet

**Status.** A **facet** attached to `U.Kind`, not a Characteristic: no algebra, **never** used in guards or composition.

**Anchors (intentional view).**
**K0** Instance; **K1** Behavioral pattern; **K2** Formal kind/class; **K3** Up‑to‑Iso.

**Use.** Helps plan **ΔF/ΔR** and forecast bridge style (e.g., K3↔K3 suggests up‑to‑iso mapping). Do **not** conflate AT with **G** or **R**.

> *Full treatment:* **C.3.5** (manager heuristics, anti‑misuse).
### Quick examples (two‑characteristic awareness)

**E‑Sketch 1 — Policy over `Vehicle`.**
Claim: “For all `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakeDistance(x) ≤ 50 m (dry), ≤ 40 m (wet).”
– **describedEntity:** `Vehicle` (Kind, typically K2) — *what* we quantify over.
– **Scope (G):** `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180d}` — *where* the claim holds.
– **Extent in slice:** which instances the lab currently classifies as `Vehicle` (via `MemberOf`).
Typed checks happen **before** Scope intersection; **G** is not widened by “abstract wording.”

**E‑Sketch 2 — API rule over `AuthenticatedRequest`.**
Producer A emits `Request`; consumer B expects `AuthenticatedRequest`.
– If `Request ⊑ AuthenticatedRequest` **does not** hold, add an **adapter** or adopt a **subkind**; do **not** force fit by widening **G**.
– Scope remains independent (API version, Γ\_time policy); evidence/freshness sits in **R**.
## How to use typed reasoning
## C.3:7.1 How typed reasoning plugs into F–G–R & USM

### The basic shape of a typed claim (manager view)

A typed claim has two independent parts:

1. **describedEntity (Kind).** *Which things the statement talks about.*
   “For every item of kind **k** in the **target context** (the selected **TargetSlice**) …”.
   — The **definition** of kind **k** lives in **KindSignature(k)** (with its **F**, C.3.2).
   — **Which items count as “k”** is evaluated in the **TargetSlice** (C.3.2) by a deterministic membership check.

2. **Applicability (Scope, G).** *Where the statement holds.*
   `U.ClaimScope(Claim)` is the **collection of contexts** where the claim is valid (USM A.2.6). Guards test: “Scope **covers** the TargetSlice”.

**Discipline.** The guard first checks **typed compatibility** (in the same Context: “is‑a / subkind‑of”; across Contexts: a **KindBridge**, C.3.3), then **Scope coverage** (USM), then **R** freshness and any bridge congruence penalties. See **C.3.A Guard\_TypedClaim**.
### Composition of typed claims

**Rule C‑T‑1 (typed pre‑check).** To compose a **producer claim** with a **consumer claim**, where the producer quantifies over kind **k (source)** and the consumer expects kind **k (expected)**:

* **same Context:** require **“is‑a / subkind‑of”** to hold (the source kind is a subkind of the expected kind) (C.3.1).
* **Cross‑context:** require a **KindBridge** that maps the source kind to a **local kind that is a subkind of the expected kind** in the target Context (C.3.3). If neither holds, the composition is **unsafe**; introduce a subkind, add an adapter (or a RoleMask), or decline.

* **Role‑aware option (same Context):** if the consumer expects a **RoleMask** over the expected kind, you may satisfy the mask’s explicit constraints (C.3.4) instead of changing kinds, provided those constraints are observable at gate time.

**Rule C‑T‑2 (scope after type).** After typed compatibility is satisfied, compute Scope as in USM:

* **Serial path:** take the **intersection** of the contributors’ claim scopes.
* **Parallel independent lines:** use **SpanUnion** of the serial scopes (only if independence is justified).

**Rule C‑T‑3 (no type‑by‑scope).** A kind mismatch **MUST NOT** be “fixed” by widening **G**. Changes in describedEntity require **subkind introduction**, **signature edits**, or a **KindBridge**—not a scope change.

**Manager hint.** First confirm the **port shape** matches (kinds line up), then check the **operating area** (scope), and finally look at **confidence** (evidence freshness plus any bridge congruence penalties).
### F–G–R with typed claims (what changes, what doesn’t)

* **F (Formality).**
  – **Claim‑level F** follows C.2.3 (weakest‑link along the claim’s support paths).
  – **KindSignature F** is declared **on the kind** (C.3.2) and influences claims **only** if the claim essentially depends on those predicates (weakest‑link again).
  – **Raising F** can *reveal* hidden assumptions (which may trigger ΔG in the claim), but **does not change G** by itself.

* **G (Scope).**
  – Always **set‑valued over Context slices** (USM A.2.6).
  – Typed reasoning does not alter G’s algebra (∈/∩/SpanUnion/translate).
  – Never infer Scope from “how general the wording sounds.”

* **R (Reliability).**
  – Evidence freshness/decay (validation windows) remains separate from Scope coverage.
  – **Cross‑context penalties** split cleanly: a **scope‑bridge penalty** (USM) and a **kind‑bridge penalty** (C.3.3). Both **reduce R only**; neither changes **F** or **G**.

**Manager rule of thumb.**
Start with the reliability from your support; then **apply the scope‑bridge penalty**; then **apply the kind‑bridge penalty**. Each step can only reduce reliability.  
You never add or average **F/G**: you **compose scope** per USM rules and apply **weakest‑link** for F/R along support paths.
### ESG gating with typed claims

* **Gate on F**, if your Context requires rigor before use (e.g., `U.Formality(Claim) ≥ F4`).
* **Gate on Scope coverage** (USM) and an explicit **time selector** (Γ_time) policy.
* **Gate on R freshness** and **minimum congruence** for bridges (e.g., `CL ≥ 2`, `CL^k ≥ 2`).
* **Do not** gate on **AT** (C.3.5); it is an informative facet only.
* Use **C.3.A guard macros** to keep guards short and auditable.
### How typed reasoning plugs into the CAL chain (Lang‑CHR → Role‑CAL)

> **Intent.** Show a clear, end‑to‑end path a manager can follow to take a typed claim from words to safe reuse across Contexts—without any tool or data‑governance assumptions. Each stage says **what it supplies**, **what it needs**, and **what it hands off** to the next stage.

#### Lang‑CHR — stable words first

**What it supplies.** A disciplined vocabulary and controlled phrasing so that terms like *Vehicle*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *AdultPatient* have **one meaning** in the Context.

**What it requires.** Authors use controlled narrative (C.2.3 **F3**) at minimum: single‑meaning terms, explicit “shall / if / then”, and no drifting synonyms.

**Hand‑off.** A small, curated lexicon entry for each candidate *Kind‑word*; these become **`U.Kind` names** in the next step.

> *Manager hint.* If two teams cannot agree on the noun, you are not ready to type the claim. Resolve the noun in Lang‑CHR before introducing a Kind.
#### Kind‑CAL (this Part) — name the describedEntity

**What it supplies.**
• **`U.Kind`** objects for those nouns; a partial order **`⊑`** (subkind‑of).
• **KindSignature(k)** (intent), with declared **F**.
• **Extension(k, slice)** and **`MemberOf(e,k,slice)`** (extent).
• (Optional) **AT (K0…K3)** as an **informative facet**.

**What it requires.**
• Deterministic membership (no “latest” defaults) and a clear rule for where membership is defined in each context.
• No “Kind scope”: Scope remains with claims/capabilities (USM).

> *Manager hint.* Use the kind’s **AT tag** only as a planning signal (where to invest rigor and tests). AT never gates decisions and never widens scope.

**Hand‑off.** Typed quantifier sites for claims: “∀ x ∈ **Extension(k, slice)** …”, plus a visible **`⊑`** lattice for compatibility checks down the line. Typed claim sites written in Plain language: “for every item of kind **k** in the **target context** …”, plus a visible **subkind‑of** lattice for compatibility checks down the line.

> *Manager hint.* Decide early whether your Kind is K0 (instance‑ish) or K2 (formal class). It sets your **ΔF/ΔR** budget expectations.
#### Structure‑CAL — give Kinds usable shape

**What it supplies.** Structural building blocks **on Kinds**:
• **combinations** (“and”),
• **alternatives** (“either/or”),
• **records** (named fields),
• **functions** (inputs to outputs),
plus relations like **has‑attribute** and **part‑kind**, and the minimal invariants those structures must respect.

**What it requires.**
• Do not hide Scope inside structure.
• Put structural rules into the **KindSignature** as checkable statements (ideally **F4+**).

**Hand‑off.** Typed *ports and shapes* of claims/specifications (“this policy expects `PassengerCar × ControllerConfig`”), making compatibility checks crisp before any Scope math.

> *Manager hint.* If two claims expect different shapes (for example, one needs “Vehicle with ABS”, the other just “Vehicle”), plan a **subkind** or an **adapter**. Do not “solve” it by rewording the claim.

**Note (informative).** If a Context declares structural constructors on kinds (e.g., product/sum/record/function), editors SHOULD document the corresponding **Extension** inclusion laws for those constructors. Keep Scope in USM; do not hide it in structure.
#### Compose‑CAL — compose with typed pre‑checks

**What it supplies.** The **order of checks** you must follow for safe composition:

1. **Typed compatibility**: in the same Context, the producer’s kind **is a subkind of** the consumer’s kind; across Contexts, a **KindBridge** maps the producer’s kind to a local kind that fits, with an acceptable **kind‑bridge congruence level** (C.3.3).
2. **Scope checks** (USM): along dependency paths, take the **intersection** of scopes; use **SpanUnion** only when support lines are truly independent.
3. **Assurance wiring**: apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**; check evidence freshness separately.

**What it requires.** Independence justification for **SpanUnion**; no “type‑by‑scope” fixes.

**Hand‑off.** A typed, scope‑checked composition that survives audit because each risk is accounted for in **R**.

> *Manager hint.* Run the **typed pre‑check** first. It is the cheapest failure to catch and prevents “scope gymnastics” that mask a type mismatch.
#### CT2R‑LOG — speak the logic, keep the math honest

**What it supplies.**
• A clear logical reading of your typed claim: “for every item of kind **K**, condition **φ** holds” (or “there exists an item …”).
• Rules for refinement and substitution that respect the **subkind‑of** relation.
• When appropriate (K3), reasoning that treats structures as **equivalent up to isomorphism** (useful where exact identity is the wrong notion).

**What it requires.**
• Pick a logic that matches the **Formality** you declare (e.g., machine‑checked logic for higher **F**).
• When the logic travels across Contexts, use a **KindBridge** to keep meaning aligned; any mismatch is reflected as a **kind‑bridge penalty** in **R**.

**Hand‑off.** Proof obligations or reasoning templates that are consistent with your Kind/Structure setup and do not alter **G**.  **Shall‑note CT2R‑1.** Transferring typed formulas that depend on `MemberOf` across Contexts **uses a KindBridge**; any mismatch is accounted as **Ψ(`CL^k`)** in **R**. **F** and **G** remain unchanged. For **up‑to‑iso** situations, see **C.3.5 (AT)** for when K3 is appropriate.

> *Manager hint.* If your proof keeps failing when you move between Contexts, add a **bridge at the Kind level**; do not try to “fix” it by changing scope.
#### Role‑CAL — adapt without cloning

**What it supplies.** **RoleMask(kind, Context)**: a named, registered adaptation (extra constraints or local aliases, with optional narrowing) that reuses the **same** kind instead of creating a new one.

**What it requires.**
• Constraints must be testable at gate time and give deterministic answers.
• If a constraint mask is reused often, **promote it to a subkind**.

**Hand‑off.** Context‑specific views that keep identity intact and make typed guards practical (“use `PaymentAccount@PCI` mask in these steps”).

> *Manager hint.* If the same mask appears in several guards, **promote** it to a subkind. This reduces future bridge and audit effort.
#### Mini end‑to‑end example (manager‑oriented)

> **Scenario.** A risk gate for API requests must be reused by another program across Contexts.

**Lang‑CHR.** Settle on *Request*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *RiskScore*, *BudgetSlack*; write them in controlled phrases (F3).

**Kind‑CAL.**
• Define `Kind Request` (K2) and a **subkind** `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ Request`;  publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **kind‑bridge congruence level 2** (loss note: token class is collapsed).
• Membership `MemberOf(e, AuthenticatedRequest, slice)` is deterministic under API v2.3 and Γ\_time policy.

**Structure‑CAL.**
• `AuthenticatedRequest` is a **record kind** with fields (headers, tokenProof, body); invariants relate tokenProof to headers.

**Compose‑CAL.**
• Policy P says in Plain terms: “for every **AuthenticatedRequest** in the **target context**, deny the call when **riskScore** is at or above the set **risk threshold** and **budgetSlack** is at or below the set **budget limit**.”
• Another service S expects `PCIRequest`. Typed pre‑check: does `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ PCIRequest`? No.
• Remedy: adapter A proves `AuthenticatedRequest → PCIRequest` in this Context; if reusing across Contexts, publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **`CL^k=2`** (loss: token class collapsed).

**CT2R‑LOG.**
• State P in a state P in a proof‑checked logic (where appropriate for F7+), so that changes to token rules break proofs. Proofs rely on the **AuthenticatedRequest** definition, not on the consumer’s scope.

**Role‑CAL.**
• Register a **RoleMask** over `PCIRequest` for the consuming team; guards must be able to test the mask’s constraints at gate time.

**Outcome.**
• **Typed guard** approves only when: (i) the type pre‑check passes (same‑Context subkind‑of or a KindBridge with an acceptable congruence level), (ii) **Scope** covers the target context (API v2.3, explicit time selector), and (iii) **R** reflects the **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties and evidence is fresh.
• No one widened Scope to hide a type mismatch; the adapter + bridge made the semantics explicit and auditable.


> **Takeaway.** If you keep these six hand‑offs in view—words → kinds → structure → composition → logic → roles—you get **predictable reviews**, **clean risk accounting**, and **reusable claims** that travel across Contexts without silent meaning drift.
### Compliance & Regulatory Alignment — profile

Treat regulatory categories as **Kinds**, carry their **intent** in `KindSignature` with declared **F**, move them across Contexts with a **KindBridge** (type‑congruence **`CL^k`** + loss notes), and express applicability as **Claim scope** over `U.ContextSlice` (with explicit **Γ_time**). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** via **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (kind) and **Φ(CL)** (scope); **F** and **G** remain unchanged.

> **Authoritative obligations and guard macros** (C‑REG‑1…8, Guard_RegAdopt / Guard_RegChange / Guard_RegXContextUse) and worked scenarios live in **C.3.A, Annex A (Regulatory adoption profile)**.
### How typed reasoning plugs into Assurance Lanes (VA/LA/TA) & Evidence design

**Intent (manager’s view).** Typed reasoning turns “prove/test/qualify” into a **repeatable plan** by making *what the rule talks about* explicit (named **Kinds**, their **subkinds**, optional **RoleMasks**) and keeping **Scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice` separate from **membership** inside the slice. Cross‑context uncertainty (Scope Bridge **CL**, KindBridge **`CL^k`**) always routes to **R** as penalties **Φ/Ψ**; it never changes **F** or **G**.

**Evidence matrix (sketch).**

| Row set                       | Column set                                                   | Cell content                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinds** (subkinds or masks) | **Context slices** (Standard versions, env ranges, `Γ_time`) | **Evidence unit** (proof fragment, test batch, monitoring window), with **Scope** and **MemberOf** predicates attached |

*Tip.* For formal kinds and “up‑to‑iso” kinds (AT K2/K3), expect **more rows** (variants). For instance‑like kinds (AT K0), expect **fewer rows** and **tighter columns** (narrow slices, stricter freshness).

> **Authoritative evidence obligations and guard macros** (planning/attachment, VA/LA/TA duties, anti‑patterns) are in **C.3.A, Annex B**.
### How typed reasoning plugs into ESG and Method–Work gating

> Intent. Make state changes and work admissions deterministic, auditable, and safe by separating (1) **typed compatibility** (what the statement or capability is about) from (2) **scope coverage** (where it holds or can run). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** (reliability) only—never to **F** (form) or **G** (scope).

#### Scope & fit

This subsection defines **normative guard obligations** for:

* **ESG** (Episteme State Graph) transitions whose assertions **quantify over kinds**, and
* **Method–Work** admissions where a **capability** expects inputs/outputs of specified kinds.

It reuses:

* **USM** (A.2.6): `U.ClaimScope` (G) and `U.WorkScope` coverage + `Γ_time`,
* **Kind‑CAL core** (C.3.1–C.3.2): `U.Kind`, `MemberOf(e,k,slice)`, `⊑`,
* **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** and loss notes,
* **Scope Bridge** (Part B) with **CL** and loss notes,
* **RoleMask** (C.3.4) when local adaptations of a kind are used,
* **Formality F** (C.2.3) when transitions gate on rigor,
* **Assurance R** (C.2.2) for evidence freshness and penalties Φ/Ψ.

**Guard macros.** The **normative guard shapes** for ESG and Method–Work (**Guard_TypedClaim**, **Guard_TypedJoin**, **Guard_MaskedUse**, **Guard_XContext_Typed**) are specified in **Annex C.3.A**. Use those shapes; the present section is a manager‑level overview only.
#### Inputs & roles (at guard time)

* **TargetSlice** — the specific context you are deciding for: Context, versioned Standards, environment parameters, and an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.
* **Typed carriers**

  * **ESG:** the **Claim** quantifies over one or more **Kinds** (e.g., “for all vehicles in the target context …”).
  * **Method–Work:** the **Capability** declares expected input/output kinds (and possibly RoleMasks).
* **Thresholds** (context‑local policy):

  * Minimum **F** level for the Claim (if the Context gates on rigor),
  * Minimum **congruence** for **scope bridges**,
  * Minimum **type‑congruence** for **KindBridges**,
  * Evidence **freshness windows** (R‑lane).
* **Evidence bundle** (if the transition implies trust): references, dates, windows.
#### Manager’s 7‑step checklist (operational)

1. **Name the slice.** Write the full `TargetSlice`/`JobSlice` tuple including **`Γ_time`**.
2. **Check coverage.** Claim/Work scope **covers** the slice (USM).
3. **Check typed definedness.** A deterministic membership check is available in this context for every kind you use (and any masks are registered).
4. **Check typed compatibility.** same Context: `⊑` (or mask constraints met). Cross‑context: **KindBridge** with **`CL^k ≥ c`**.
5. **Bridge scope if needed.** Scope Bridge with **CL ≥ c** for Cross‑context scope.
6. **Apply penalties to R.** Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty**; then check evidence **freshness** windows.
7. **(If gated) Check F.** Enforce `Formality ≥ F_k` for the transition.

> **Remember:** **F** and **G** never change because of bridges; only **R** is penalized. AT (K0…K3) is informative and **not** used in guards.
#### Cross‑references

* **USM / A.2.6:** Scope coverage, `Γ_time`, serial **∩**, **SpanUnion**, Bridge+CL.
* **Kind‑CAL / C.3.1–C.3.4:** `U.Kind`, `⊑`, `MemberOf`, RoleMask, KindBridge + **`CL^k`**.
* **Formality / C.2.3:** `U.Formality` thresholds (when ESG gates on rigor).
* **Assurance / C.2.2:** Freshness windows; **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** penalties to **R** (weakest‑link on paths).

This subsection is **normative** for guards in ESG and Method–Work that **use kinds**.
## Cross‑context typed reuse & assurance accounting

### The two‑bridge rule (mandatory)

When any part of the use crosses Contexts:

1. **Scope Bridge** (USM/Part B) with **CL** → penalty **Φ(CL)** to **R**.
2. **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** → penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.

Both bridges carry **loss notes**; neither changes **F** or **G**. See **C.3.A Guard\_XContext\_Typed**.
### Narrowing after mapping (best practice)

If a bridge’s loss notes indicate material mismatch (dropped invariants, collapsed subkinds):

* **Narrow the mapped Scope** to areas where those losses are benign.
* **Or** introduce an **adapter** (plus evidence) that restores the needed properties in the target Context.
* Document the decision; the penalties still land in **R**.
### Typical Cross‑context patterns (manager’s catalog)

* **Name‑level overlap only (low `CL^k`).**
  Expect significant Ψ penalty. Limit quantification, add local checks, or refuse reuse until the kind mapping is improved.

* **Up‑to‑iso mapping (high `CL^k`).**
  Often seen for K3 kinds. Ψ penalty is small; treat as “shape‑preserving” transfer. Still apply the appropriate **Φ(CL)** for Scope.

* **Mask‑to‑subkind evolution.**
  If receivers repeatedly use the same **RoleMask** to make a transfer safe, promote it to an explicit **subkind** and update the bridge to preserve that link.
### Decision pattern (fast path)

1. **Typed pre‑check:** `k_A ⊑ k_B` (same Context) **or** `KindBridge(k_A → k′_B)` with acceptable **`CL^k`**.
2. **Scope coverage:** `translate(Scope_A)` covers `TargetSlice_B`.
3. **Apply penalties:** **Φ(CL\_scope)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R**.
4. **Freshness:** windows/decay for all bound evidence.
5. **Publish:** a short “Bridge and Loss Notes” box; include any **narrowing** or **adapters** used.
## Authoring guidance (engineers‑managers)

### When to mint a U.Kind

Create a Kind when:

* multiple claims refer to the **same “describedEntity”** using unstable labels;
* you need **subkinds** (refinement) or repeated **RoleMasks**;
* different Contexts must **map** this “describedEntity” via bridges;
* you need to **quantify** over a population (and plan variant coverage) instead of over a single exemplar.

Avoid creating a Kind for **one‑off** instance references—prefer a clear **K0** facet or just a literal exemplar in the claim.
### Writing a KindSignature (and picking F)

* Start with a concise **intent**: the invariants/constraints that make membership meaningful.
* Aim for **F4** (predicate‑like) if the kind is intended for reuse; rise to **F7+** only where proof‑grade is justified.
* Use **observable** terms (no “latest”); if a Standard matters, **name its version**.
* If defining a Kind reveals systematic **narrowings** in use, introduce explicit **subkinds** (`⊑`) rather than accumulating opaque masks.

> **Example (sketch).**
> `Kind Vehicle` — intent: “has VIN; has brake system; has propulsion {ICE, EV, Hybrid}; …” (F4 predicates).
> Subkind: `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`.
> RoleMask: `Vehicle@ABSRequired` for processes that demand ABS (deterministic constraints; candidates for promotion to subkind if widely reused).
### Setting the AT facet (K0…K3)

Use **AT** to **aim effort**, not to gate:

* **K0**: instance/cohort — focus **R** on the TargetSlice; don’t over‑formalize.
* **K1**: behavioral pattern — clarify Standards; plan ΔF (F3→F4).
* **K2**: formal class — invest in F4–F7; plan **variant coverage** across subkinds in **R**.
* **K3**: up‑to‑iso — expect high‑quality bridges; consider F7–F9 for critical invariants.

Never treat **AT** as “wider/narrower” **G**.
### Writing a typed claim (with USM blocks)

**Skeleton.**

* **Kinds used:** `Vehicle` (K2), subkinds `PassengerCar`.
* **Claim scope (G):** `surface∈{dry,wet}; speed≤50; rig=v3; Γ_time=rolling 180d`.
* **Statement:** `∀ x ∈ Extension(Vehicle, TargetSlice) …`
* **Guards:** use **C.3.A Guard\_TypedClaim**; if Cross‑context, add **Guard\_XContext\_Typed** (two‑bridge rule).

**Tip.** Keep **Scope**, **MemberOf definedness**, **F thresholds**, and **freshness** as **separate** guard predicates—the auditor should be able to tick each box independently.
### Minimal “Kind card” contents (Context catalog)

* **Name** and **intent summary** (KindSignature snippet + **F**).
* **`⊑` links** (parents/children).
* **Examples of `MemberOf@slice`** (what membership looks like in practice).
* **Known RoleMasks** (type, constraints, determinism).
* **Known KindBridges** (source/target Contexts, **`CL^k`**, loss notes, definedness).
* *(Optional)* **AT** facet with one‑line rationale.
## 10 - Review & integration guidance

### Reviewer’s 8‑point checklist

1. **Named describedEntity.** Does the claim state **what** it quantifies over (`U.Kind`)?
2. **Scope explicit.** Is **G** declared (no “domain” placeholders, no implicit “latest”)?
3. **Typed compatibility.** For compositions, do we have `⊑` (same Context) or a **KindBridge**?
4. **RoleMasks.** If used, are they **registered**, **deterministic**, and not masquerading as kinds?
5. **Two‑bridge rule.** For Cross‑context use, do we have **both** Scope Bridge (**CL**) and **KindBridge** (**`CL^k`**)?
6. **Penalties.** Are **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** applied to **R**, not smuggled into F/G?
7. **Freshness.** Are validation/monitoring windows separate from Scope coverage?
8. **Evidence fit.** For class‑level claims, does the test plan cover **subkinds/variants**?
### Integrator’s composition playbook (typed first, then scope)

* **Step 1:** Check `k_A ⊑ k_B` (or KindBridge).
* **Step 2:** Compute **Scope\_serial** = `Scope(A) ∩ Scope(B)` (USM).
* **Step 3:** If parallel supports exist, **SpanUnion** them (only where independent).
* **Step 4:** Apply **Φ**/**Ψ** penalties to **R**; enforce freshness.
* **Step 5:** If a **mask** is repeatedly required, consider promoting it to a **subkind**.
### Assurance lead: wiring penalties and windows

* Identify channels used: **Scope bridge? KindBridge?**
* Apply **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** to **R** (monotone; higher congruence ⇒ smaller penalty).
* Verify **freshness windows** for all bound evidence (independent of bridges).
* Publish a **one‑box summary**: bridges, levels, loss notes, any narrowing/adapters, net impact on **R**.
### Red flags (stop‑the‑line)

* “**We widened G because we reworded the type.**” → **Reject**; redo as subkind/bridge or revise Scope honestly.
* “**Mask equals kind.**” → **Refactor**; register mask properly or promote to subkind.
* “**Cross‑context without KindBridge.**” → **Block**; demand mapping and **`CL^k`**.
* “**No Γ\_time.**” → **Block**; add explicit time policy (point/window/rolling).
## Worked examples (end‑to‑end)

> *Each example shows the typed pre‑check, Scope composition, penalties to **R**, and the managerial decision. Full guard clauses for these scenarios are in **Annex C.3.A**.*

### Cyber‑physical braking policy across labs and plants

**Claim (Lab Context).**
“∀ `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakingDistance(x) ≤ 50 m (dry), ≤ 40 m (wet).”
**Kinds.** `Vehicle` (K2, KindSignature F4); subkind `PassengerCar ⊑ Vehicle`.
**Scope (Lab).** `{surface∈{dry,wet}, speed≤50, rig=v3, Γ_time=rolling 180d}`.

**Reuse at Plant B.**
– **KindBridge:** `Vehicle ↦ TransportUnit` with **`CL^k=2`** (loss: EV subkind collapsed).
– **Scope Bridge:** `Lab → PlantB` with **CL=2** (rig bias ±2 %).
– **Narrowing:** loss notes indicate wet‑surface bias; Plant B **narrows** mapped Scope to temp/adhesion ranges with acceptable bias.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check: **OK** via KindBridge. Scope coverage after translate/narrow: **OK**.
Penalties: apply **Φ(2)** and **Ψ(2)** to **R**; freshness windows checked.
**Outcome:** Adopt with reduced **R**; action item: qualify rig v4 to raise CL in the future.
### API decision rule with adapter and subkind promotion

**Consumer claim.**
“∀ `x ∈ AuthenticatedRequest`: deny if riskScore(x) ≥ θ ∧ budgetSlack ≤ β.”

**Producer reality.**
Service A emits `Request` (no auth guarantee).
**Option A:** A proves it emits `AuthenticatedRequest` (introduce subkind or strengthen Standard).
**Option B:** Insert **adapter** that filters/annotates `Request → AuthenticatedRequest`.

**Typed check.**
Before: no `Request ⊑ AuthenticatedRequest`. After **Option B**: adapter supplies the guarantee; repeated use leads to promoting **mask** to **subkind**.

**Scope.**
API v2.3; Γ\_time = rolling 30 d.
**R.**
No Cross‑context reuse; no Φ/Ψ. Evidence: adapter correctness on the TargetSlice.

**Outcome.**
Adopt via Option B; open task: generalize producer to subkind and remove adapter later.
### Clinical dosage rule across jurisdictions (bridge + mask)

**Claim (Hospital X).**
“∀ `x ∈ AdultPatient`: dosage ≤ D per kg for drug M.”
**Kind.** `AdultPatient` (K2, F4).
**Mask.** `AdultPatient@ClinicMask` narrows to the clinic’s cohort (deterministic DOB policy).

**Reuse in Jurisdiction Y.**
– **KindBridge:** `AdultPatient ↦ AdultPerson_Y`, **`CL^k=1`** (18 vs 21 years boundary).
– **Scope Bridge:** coding systems differ (CL depends on mapping quality).
– **Narrowing:** restrict Scope to datasets where DOB granularity supports boundary reconciliation.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check via KindBridge: **OK**. Scope coverage after translate/narrow: **OK**.
Penalties: **Φ(CL\_scope)** and **Ψ(1)** applied to **R**.
**Outcome:** Adopt with strong **R** penalty; plan: negotiate a harmonized boundary to raise `CL^k`.
### ML fairness constraint with typed quantification

**Claim (Product Context).**
“∀ `x ∈ EligiblePerson`: TPR difference ≤ δ across groups `G`.”

**Kind.** `EligiblePerson` transitions from **K1→K2** as attributes and cohorts are formalized (KindSignature F4).
**Scope.** `{pipeline=P, features=F, Γ_time=rolling 180 d}`.

**Cross‑context use.**
Model team Context has `Resident` with different feature basis.
– **KindBridge:** `EligiblePerson ↦ Resident` with **`CL^k=1`** (feature loss).
– **Scope Bridge:** `pipeline P → P′`, **CL=2**.

**Decision.**
Typed pre‑check **OK** via bridges; mapped Scope **covers** the subset where features align.
Apply **Φ(2)** and **Ψ(1)** to **R**; restrict groups to mapped subset; require monitoring freshness.
**Outcome:** Adopt with reduced **R** and a mitigation note; action items: improve feature mapping and raise KindSignature F.
## Anti‑patterns & how to fix them

> *Use this section as a “red flags” sheet in reviews. Each item links to a concrete remedy that preserves F–G–R & USM discipline (F/G/R separation, USM algebra, typed pre‑checks).*

| Anti‑pattern (what goes wrong)                                   | Why it’s wrong (conceptual fault)                                                               | The fix (normative/informative pointers)                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“We widened G because we reworded the type.”**                 | Confuses **describedEntity** (kind) with **applicability** (scope). Abstract wording ≠ broader scope. | Keep typed pre‑check separate (C.3.1 `⊑` or C.3.3 KindBridge). Widen **G** only via **ΔG+** with support (USM A.2.6).                                 |
| **“Kind scope” block attached to a Kind.**                       | Kinds don’t carry Scope; they carry **intent/extent**.                                          | Remove the block. Scope stays on claims/capabilities (USM). If you meant classifier definedness, state it via **K‑07** (C.3.2).                       |
| **Inferring scope from extension size.**                         | **Scope ≠ Extension**; extension is “which instances in a slice,” not “where the claim holds.”  | Keep **G** set‑valued over `U.ContextSlice` (USM). Use `MemberOf` only inside the typed quantifier.                                                   |
| **Mask used as a hidden kind (“just call it the masked kind”).** | Opaque drift; reviewers can’t see constraints.                                                  | Register a **RoleMask** (C.3.4). If reused across guards, **promote to subkind** with `⊑`.                                                            |
| **Cross‑context reuse with only one bridge.**                       | Contexts differ on two characteristics: Scope **and** Kind.                                                   | Apply the **two‑bridge rule**: Scope Bridge (**CL** → Φ) **and** KindBridge (**`CL^k`** → Ψ). Both penalties land in **R**.                           |
| **Using AT (K0…K3) as a gate/threshold.**                        | AT is an **informative facet**, not a Characteristic; gating on AT recreates a G‑ladder.        | Remove AT from guards. Use it only to **aim ΔF/ΔR** and to set **bridge expectations** (C.3.5).                                                       |
| **“Automated execution success proves the type claim.”**                            | Execution success (F5/6) is not proof (F7+); also confuses **R** with **F**.                    | If you need proof‑grade properties, raise **F** for the claim/KindSignature (C.2.3) or restrict the claim. Keep **R** as evidence freshness/coverage. |
| **Hidden “latest” in membership or scope checks.**               | Non‑deterministic evaluation; unverifiable audit trail.                                         | Declare **Γ\_time** explicitly in Scope (USM). Membership must be **deterministic** (C.3.2 K‑05/K‑07).                                                |
| **Fixing type mismatch by “unioning scopes.”**                   | G‑union cannot repair **describedEntity** mismatches.                                                 | Introduce a **subkind**, add an **adapter** (+evidence), or define a **KindBridge**.                                                                  |
| **Collapsing subkinds silently in a bridge.**                    | Reviewers don’t see lost distinctions → false confidence.                                       | Record **loss notes** on the KindBridge (C.3.3 KB‑11); consider **narrowing** mapped Scope or adding an adapter.                                      |
## Governance & conformance pull‑ups

> *Contexts adopt Kind‑CAL by meeting the **Context‑level** obligations below. They summarize, not duplicate, the formal requirements in **C.3.1–C.3.5** and **C.3.A**. Use this as an adoption checklist.*

### Context‑level obligations (must‑haves)

1. **Kinds & order.** Maintain a Context catalog of `U.Kind` with an explicit **partial order** `⊑`.
   – Conformance: **C.3.1** (K‑01/K‑02).

2. **Kind signatures (intent).** For each Kind, publish a **KindSignature** with declared **F** (C.2.3).
   – Conformance: **C.3.2** (K‑03/K‑04).

3. **Deterministic membership.** Ensure `MemberOf(e,k,slice)` is **deterministic**; declare any definedness domain.
   – Conformance: **C.3.2** (K‑05/K‑07).

4. **Typed guards.** When a claim quantifies over kinds, guards SHALL use the **typed guard macros** (or equivalents) from **C.3.A**; **Scope coverage** and **typed checks** are separate predicates.

5. **Role masks.** If a local projection is needed, register a **RoleMask** (type: constraint/vocabulary/composite); avoid cloning kinds.
   – Conformance: **C.3.4** (RM‑01…RM‑06).

6. **Two‑bridge rule for Cross‑context use.**
   – **Scope Bridge** (Part B) with **CL** → Φ(CL) to **R**.
   – **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** → Ψ(`CL^k`) to **R**.
   – Conformance: **C.3.3** (KB‑01…KB‑10).

7. **Decision records.** For each typed state change, record: **TargetSlice tuple**, typed compatibility outcome (`⊑` or KindBridge), **Scope coverage**, applied **Φ/Ψ** penalties to **R**, and **freshness** checks.
### ESG / Method‑Work template inserts (normative snippets)

* **Kinds used:** list `U.Kind` and any expected **subkinds** or **RoleMasks**.
* **Claim scope (G):** explicit predicates over `U.ContextSlice` inc. **Γ\_time**.
* **Typed guard lines:**
  – same Context: `k_A ⊑ k_B` *checked*.
  – Cross Context: `KindBridge(k_A → k′_B)`, `CL^k ≥ c_k` *checked*.
* **Scope bridge lines:** `Bridge(Context_A → Context_B)`, `CL ≥ c_s` *checked*.
* **Assurance lines:** `Φ(CL)`, `Ψ(CL^k)` applied to **R**; **freshness windows** hold.
### Audits & levels of adoption (informative)

* **USM‑Typed‑Ready.** Catalog exists; `⊑` declared; guard macros installed.
* **USM‑Typed‑Guarded.** All typed claims use **C.3.A** guard shapes; **Γ\_time** explicit; two‑bridge rule enforced.
* **USM‑Typed‑Auditable.** Decision records capture **TargetSlice**, typed checks, bridges, penalties, freshness.
* **USM‑Typed‑Composed.** Compositions use typed pre‑check before Scope algebra; independence justified for **SpanUnion**.
## Migration & editorial impact

> *Apply these edits incrementally; you do not need to stop other work. The aim is to eliminate synonym drift, restore F/G/R separation, and make typed reasoning routine.*

### Inventory & refactor (steps)

1. **Inventory** claims that implicitly talk about “things” (vehicles, requests, accounts, cohorts…).
2. **Name kinds** for recurring “describedEntity”; start at **K1**; promote to **K2** as invariants stabilize.
3. **Extract KindSignature** (aim **F4**); declare **F**.
4. **Refactor claims** to typed quantification: `∀ x ∈ Extension(k, slice) …` plus **Scope (G)** predicates.
5. **Publish bridges** where reuse is Cross‑context: Scope Bridge (**CL**) and KindBridge (**`CL^k`**) with loss notes; wire penalties **Φ/Ψ** to **R**.
6. **Normalize masks**: register RoleMasks; if reused, promote to subkinds (`⊑`).
### Edits to other parts (normative redirects, no new math)

* **A.2.6 (USM).**
  – Add “no Scope on kinds” note.
  – In typed examples, show `MemberOf` definedness + Scope coverage.
  – Two‑bridge rule for Cross‑context typed reuse.

* **C.2.2 (F–G–R).**
  – Replace any “generality/abstraction” wording with **Claim scope (G)**.
  – Before scope composition, require typed pre‑check (`⊑` or KindBridge).
  – Distinguish penalties: **Φ(CL)** vs **Ψ(`CL^k`)** → both to **R**.

* **C.2.3 (F).**
  – Add note: **KindSignature** has its own **F**; claim‑level F remains by weakest‑link.

* **Part B (Bridges).**
 – Introduce **KindBridge** with **`CL^k`**, monotone order preservation, loss notes; determinism.
 – Chaining uses **min** of levels (weakest‑link) **for both** **CL** (Scope bridges) **and** **`CL^k`** (KindBridges).


* **Role‑CAL.**
  – Add **RoleMask** for kinds; determinism; promotion rule to subkind when reused.

* **Compose‑CAL.**
  – Add typed pre‑check before Scope algebra; forbid “type‑by‑scope”.

* **Part E (Lexicon).**
  – Add: `U.Kind`, `U.SubkindOf (⊑)`, `KindSignature`(+F), `Extension`, `MemberOf`, `U.RoleMask`, **KindBridge**, `CL^k`, **AT (kinds, facet)**.
  – Mark as **legacy aliases** (not characteristic names): *generality (as ladder), kind scope, validity (as characteristic), capability envelope*; redirect to **Claim/Work scope** or **Kind** entries.
### Backwards compatibility

* Historical prose may keep legacy words. **Guards, conformance text, and state assertions** MUST use the Kind‑CAL/USM vocabulary and guard shapes.
* When annotating older records, add a small “typed note” box: **Kinds**, **Scope**, **Bridges (CL/`CL^k`)**, **loss notes**, **penalties to R**.
## Extended rationale & design notes \[I]

> *This section explains the design choices that keep Kind‑CAL compact and interoperable with F–G–R & USM without drifting into tooling or technology stacks.*

### Why no Scope on kinds

Scope answers **“where the claim holds”** (set of Context slices, USM); kinds answer **“what the claim is about”**. Putting Scope on kinds would either (a) duplicate claim Scope, or (b) smuggle applicability into a classifier. We prevent both by: **intent/extent on kinds** (C.3.2), **Scope on claims/capabilities** (USM).
### Why two bridges (Scope vs Kind)

Contexts diverge along **context** (Standards, parameters, time) and **classification** (what counts as a member). A single bridge hides which characteristic is mismatched. Two explicit bridges keep fixes targeted: **ΔG / narrowing** for context misfit; **subkind/adapter** for classification misfit. Both risks land in **R** as separate penalties (**Φ/Ψ**).
### Why AT is a facet

AT (K0…K3) improves **planning** (ΔF/ΔR, bridge style) and **navigation** without introducing new algebra. Making AT a Characteristic would recreate a “G‑ladder,” blur applicability with abstraction, and invite gating on AT. As a facet, AT remains helpful but **toothless in math**, which is precisely what we want.
### Why RoleMask and not “clone a kind”

Operational tweaks (extra constraints, local aliases) are real but temporary. Cloning kinds creates drift and duplicate bridges. **RoleMask** documents the tweak **without breaking identity**; promotion to subkind occurs when practice stabilizes. This keeps catalogs small and bridges honest.
### Fit with Compose‑CAL and LOG‑CAL

Typed pre‑checks (same‑Context `⊑` or KindBridge) act like **port compatibility** before any Scope arithmetic. LOG‑CAL benefits from explicit quantification `∀ x : Kind` with substitution rules aligned to `⊑`. Neither alters F/G/R algebra; they prevent category mistakes before we do trust math.
### CT2R lens (intuition)

A **KindBridge** behaves like a **functor** that (approximately) preserves structure between Contexts; **`CL^k`** is a practical knob for “how functorial” it is. At **K3** (up‑to‑iso), this is literal: we expect bridges to preserve equivalences, hence higher `CL^k` and smaller Ψ penalties.
## Rationale (Part E form)

**Problem.** (recap)
— Authors conflate *describedEntity* with *applicability*, widening G by abstract wording.
— Cross‑context reuse drifts semantically without declared mappings or risk accounting.
— Planning misfires: over‑formalization for instance claims; under‑testing for class claims.
— Unsafe compositions when describedEntity is implicit.

**Forces.** (recap)
— Local freedom vs global sense; minimality vs utility; intent vs extent; typed discipline vs F–G–R; abstraction vs applicability.

**Decision (C.3‑D1…D7).**
— D1: `U.Kind` is intensional and context‑local (`⊑` partial order).
— D2: Separate intent (KindSignature + F) and extent (Extension/MemberOf@slice).
— D3: No Scope on kinds (Scope lives with claims/capabilities via USM).
— D4: Typed reuse is explicit: KindBridge + `CL^k`, penalties route to **R** only.
— D5: Local adaptation via RoleMask; promote stable masks to subkinds.
— D6: AT (K0…K3) as **facet**, not a Characteristic; never used in guards.
— D7: Guard shapes: typed pre‑check → scope coverage → penalties/freshness.

**Consequences.**
(+) Predictable Cross‑context reuse: two‑bridge rule, separate penalties (Φ/Ψ) to **R**.  
(+) Manager‑friendly planning: AT guides ΔF/ΔR; typed pre‑check blocks category mistakes.  
(+) Clean F–G–R discipline: no “G‑ladder,” no hidden scope inside classifiers.  
(−) Editorial discipline required: no “Kind scope”; masks must be cataloged; promote when stable.  
(−) Initial bridge authoring cost; mitigated by loss‑notes and reuse.

**Alternatives considered.**
— *Global U.Type*: rejected as either too thin or too prescriptive across Contexts.  
— *“Kind scope” in USM*: rejected; duplicates/obscures Scope vs Extension split.

**Known uses.**
— §11.1 (cyber‑physical braking); §11.2 (API with adapter); §11.3 (clinical dosage); §11.4 (ML fairness).  
— ESG guard shapes in **C.3.A**; typed pre‑check in Compose‑CAL (§7.2.4).

## Quick reference for managers

### 10‑minute start

1. Name the **Kind** your claim talks about.
2. Write **Scope (G)** as slice predicates (with **Γ\_time**).
3. If composing, check **`⊑`** or **KindBridge** first.
4. Use the **typed guard macro** (C.3.A).
5. Route bridge levels to **R** (Φ/Ψ); check freshness.
### 30‑day rollout plan

Week 1: Inventory & name Kinds (K1); adopt guard macros.
Week 2: Draft **KindSignature** for the top 5 Kinds (aim **F4**); register masks.
Week 3: Wire **two‑bridge rule** into ESG; add CL/`CL^k` lines to decision templates.
Week 4: Promote repeated masks to subkinds; publish first **KindBridge** records with loss notes.
## Local glossary (reading aid)

> *Canonical definitions live in sub‑patterns; this list is for quick recall while reading C.3.*

* **`U.Kind`** — Minimal intensional “type/kind” object; carries **KindSignature** and **`⊑`** (C.3.1/C.3.2).
* **`U.SubkindOf (⊑)`** — Partial order on kinds (C.3.1).
* **KindSignature(k)** — Predicate‑like intent that defines the kind; has its own **F** (C.3.2).
* **Extension(k, slice)** — Set of instances of `k` **inside** a `U.ContextSlice` (C.3.2).
* **MemberOf(e, k, slice)** — Boolean membership predicate (C.3.2).
* **RoleMask(k, Context)** — Registered adaptation (constraints/aliases; optional narrowing), no new kind (C.3.4).
* **KindBridge** — Cross‑context mapping for kinds (intent/order) with **`CL^k`** and loss notes (C.3.3).
* **`CL^k`** — Kind‑congruence level; penalty **Ψ(`CL^k`)** goes to **R** (C.3.3).
* **AT (K0…K3)** — Informative facet of a Kind; aids planning/navigation; never used in guards (C.3.5).
* **Guard macros** — Typed guard shapes for ESG/composition (C.3.A).
