# U.ActionInvitationPrecisionRestoration — Affordance / Action-Invitation Precision Restoration (ACT-INV)
> Pattern `A.6.A` · Stable · Architectural (A) · Normative (Core / Draft)
> Part A - Kernel Architecture Cluster

> **Type:** Architectural (A)

> **Normativity:** Normative (Core / Draft)

**Plain-name.** Affordance / action-invitation precision restoration.

**Intent.**
Provide a reusable discipline for repairing overloaded **affordance / action-first** language in FPF texts.

This pattern is an **A.6.P RPR specialisation** for **post-threshold** material: it turns bare action-oriented prose into one explicit, slot-explicit **action invitation** relation family with a declared **sense family**, lawful **normal forms** (`CuePack | ActionOption | OptionSet | PolicyHook`), explicit **change semantics**, and lexical guardrails.
Pre-threshold action-guiding material remains with `A.16.1` / `B.4.1` until the cue is articulated enough for `actionInvitation(...)` publication.
It does **not** mint a parallel execution ontology: whenever an invitation is articulated far enough to reference executable artifacts, publication SHALL dock to **A.15** surfaces (`U.Method`, `U.MethodDescription`, `U.WorkPlan`, and later `U.Work`) rather than inventing new action kinds by prose.

It allows ecological-psychology, phenomenological, active-inference, control-theoretic, interface, engineering-operations, and robotics uses to coexist **without false identity by label**.

**Placement.**
Part A > cluster **A.6 Signature Stack & Boundary Discipline** > specialisation of **A.6.P** for under-specified affordance / action-first language.

**Builds on.**
A.3, A.6, A.6.B, A.6.P, A.6.S, A.6.0, A.6.5, A.2.6, A.7, A.15, E.8, E.10, F.9, F.18.

**Coordinates with.**
**A.6.Q** for evaluative-language repair; **C.2.2a / A.16 / A.16.1 / A.16.2 / B.4.1** for language-state chart positions, articulation/closure coordination, lawful moves, early cue routing, responsibility handoff, and lawful retreat when a published invitation must be reopened; use **A.16.0** only when lineage, branch, loss, or handoff history itself must be published as an explicit trajectory account; **B.5.2.0** when the strongest lawful continuation is still an open probe question rather than an invitation; **C.2.LS / C.2.4 / C.2.5 / C.2.6 / C.2.7** for articulation, closure, anchoring, and representation-factor facets referenced but not owned here; **A.10/B.3** for evidence and assurance; **B.4/B.5** for anomaly-driven cycles; **E.17/E.18** for viewpoint publication; **F.9.1** for bridge-stance annotations; **C.3.3** for kind-bridge repair when endpoint kind mismatches appear.

**Non-goal.**
This pattern does **not** assert that physical affordances, interface affordances, social affordances, epistemic probe moves, articulation-closure moves, latent policy cues, and control opportunities are one concept.

Its job is to publish a disciplined **bridge reading** across those traditions while preventing false identity by shared language.

It also does **not** assert that every trigger use of action-first language is lawfully repaired by `actionInvitation(...)`:

* where the repaired statement is primarily **evaluative**, use **A.6.Q**;
* where it is primarily about **general capability**, use functional / method description;
* where it is primarily **deontic**, route via **A.6.B**;
* where it is primarily about **scheduled or executed enactment**, dock to **A.15** (`U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` / `U.WorkPlan`, and later `U.Work`) rather than letting `actionInvitation(...)` become a shadow execution model.

FPF repeatedly encounters a predictable precision failure mode around **affordance / action-first** language.

## Content

## Problem frame

FPF repeatedly encounters a predictable precision failure mode around **affordance / action-first** language.

Authors say:

* “this handle affords pulling”
* “the interface invites confirmation”
* “the alarm calls for rollback”
* “this discrepancy suggests probing deeper”
* “the draft is ready for formalization”
* “the model wants to brake”
* “the situation is actionable”

…but the intended meaning is actually one of several different **action-oriented families**, for example:

1. **Physical affordance** — a material/environmental configuration offers a bodily action to an embodied agent.
2. **Interface affordance** — an interface face, operator panel, alarm, or publication face presents an operator move.
3. **Social affordance** — another agent or interactional setting invites a response or coordination move.
4. **Epistemic probe move** — a problem situation invites asking, comparing, measuring, testing, or instrumenting.
5. **Closure-advance move** — a situation invites naming, rescoping, proxy declaration, or formalization.
6. **Latent policy cue** — a learned/distributed state carries an action-oriented tendency not yet locally articulated.
7. **Control opportunity** — a closed-loop state invites braking, rollback, replan, isolate, escalate, or override.

The recurrent failure modes are:

* **Site confusion.** The locus of the invitation is unclear: object, scene, interface object, description, carrier, policy state, or problem episode.
* **Enactor confusion.** It is unclear **which system / collective system / role-holder** is invited to act: human operator, robot controller, research team, review service, or some unnamed “system”.
* **Action confusion.** The candidate action is hidden behind vague language like *actionable*, *calls for*, *ready for*, *natural next step*.
* **Invitation vs obligation collapse.** A situation that merely invites an action is rewritten as if it already created a duty.
* **Invitation vs capability collapse.** A local, situated action opportunity is rewritten as if it were a general capability claim.
* **Invitation vs work collapse.** Offered action is narrated as if it had already been executed.
* **Substrate confusion.** Ecological, embodied, latent-distributed, and symbolic-local action cues are silently collapsed.
* **Bridge illusion.** Similar language across traditions is mistaken for sameness.
* **Premature closure.** An early cue is published as if it were already a committed method, gate, or policy.
## Problem

How can FPF let authors use the communicative convenience of **affordance / action-first** language while preventing category errors when the language crosses:

* ecological / phenomenological discourse,
* interface and operator-facing discourse,
* active-inference / world-model discourse,
* control / monitoring / incident-response discourse,
* robotics / embodied-AI discourse,
* epistemic exploration and problem-framing discourse?
## Forces

* **Action speed vs auditability.** Action-first language is attractive because it is fast; that same speed makes it unsafe at boundaries.
* **Situated coupling vs explicit publication.** Affordances arise in agent–environment or policy–world coupling, but boundary use requires explicit local publication.
* **Preconceptual cue vs later articulation.** Some invitations are real before they are stably worded.
* **Enactor specificity vs shared discourse.** A cue may be visible to one detector yet relevant to another would-be enactor.
* **Opportunity vs obligation.** Not every invitation is a gate or commitment.
* **Option plurality vs premature scalarisation.** Several candidate actions may co-exist without a lawful total ordering.
* **Cross-tradition dialogue vs false unification.** The framework should support parallels without asserting identity.
* **Progressive closure.** An action cue may later become an option, then a policy hook, and only later a formal gate or work plan.
## Solution - Stable lens -> Sense Family -> Slots -> Normal Form -> Change Lexicon -> Guardrails

### Trigger rule

A use of affordance / action-first language is in scope for A.6.A when any of the following holds:

* the prose uses tokens such as **affords**, **invites**, **calls for**, **actionable**, **ready for**, **ripe for**, **natural next step**, **the model wants**, **the interface tells**, **this problem asks for**;
* a boundary, gate, incident note, design note, or review note uses such language for admission, selection, triage, or action guidance;
* different traditions are compared using the same action-first wording;
* a draft introduces *model affordance*, *interface affordance*, *actionable insight*, *policy invitation*, or *ready for formalization* without declared sense;
* the author intends the phrase to carry more than one of: situational action opportunity, latent cue, operator move, probe move, closure move, or control move.
### Operational repair sequence

When the trigger fires, authors SHOULD follow the A.6.P repair path:

1. **Capture the trigger span.**
   Copy the exact surface phrase.

2. **Reconstruct the candidate set.**
   Enumerate plausible candidate interpretations, including:

   * candidate **relation families** (`actionInvitation` vs `evaluativeAscription` vs capability claim vs commitment vs work occurrence),
   * candidate **site lane maps** over A.7 (`Object | Description | Carrier`),
   * candidate **would-be enactor lanes**,
   * candidate **action tuples**.

   If the occurrence is decision-bearing or publication-bearing, record a short **Candidate-Set Note** before selecting a repair.

3. **Select one explicit action-invitation sense.**
   Pick one `ActionInvitationSense` token and state why rivals were rejected in this local context.

4. **Emit a slot-explicit rewrite.**
   Rewrite the sentence into one explicit `actionInvitation(...)` record with site, would-be enactor, candidate action, coupling frame, detector/viewpoint, normal form, and qualifiers.

5. **Route boundary-bearing consequences.**
   If the repaired statement is used for admissibility, commitments, publication, automation, or evidence-bearing decisions, route the downstream hooks through **A.6.B** and, where enactment is implied, through **A.15**, instead of letting the vague action-first phrase carry that burden by itself.
### Post-threshold lens: action-invitation routing anchored by actionInvitation(...)

A.6.A stabilises the ambiguity cluster by treating in-scope post-threshold affordance/action-first statements as **qualified action-oriented material that must publish an explicit action-invitation normal form and declared downstream routing**, not as bare adjectives or rhetorical verbs.
Early action-guiding material may remain in `A.16.1` / `B.4.1` as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed route-bounded upstream publication before this pattern is entered.
`A.6.A` is therefore entered only once local `AE` is high enough to name site / enactor / action structure explicitly and local `CD` is high enough that one invitation reading is worth publishing as a relation record rather than remaining mere route pressure. If the strongest lawful publication is still a cue pack, routed cue, or open abductive prompt, stay in `A.16.1` / `B.4.1` / `B.5.2.0`.
If a published `actionInvitation(...)` later loses that minimal articulation/closure support, retreat via `A.16.2` rather than leaving a stale invitation record in force.

In A.6.P terms, this pattern fixes one post-threshold relation family and one downstream routing discipline:
* **`actionInvitation`** — the explicit post-threshold relation kind for affordance, invitation, control-opportunity, probe-move, and closure-advance rewrites once the material is articulated enough to publish a relation record.
### RelationKind contract skeleton for actionInvitation

The family-specific `RelationKind` token is **`actionInvitation`**.
Its contract publication SHALL declare, at minimum:

* **(L)** applicability in the local Context/plane set;
* **(L)** site-centred polarity: the relation is about a **site/situation** inviting a candidate action **for** an enactor; it SHALL NOT be silently rewritten as a monadic property of an object alone;
* **(L)** participant SlotSpecs for site, invited enactor, candidate action, sense, coupling frame, and normal-form positions;
* **(A)** repair paths for site-kind and enactor-kind mismatches: explicit narrowing, `KindBridge`, and/or `retargetSite(...)` / `retargetInvitedEnactor(...)`;
* **(L)** qualifier expectations for `scope`, `Γ_time`, `viewpoint`, `view`, `representationSubstrate`, `bridgeRef`, and (when relevant) `articulationHint`;
* **(D)** detector/enactor separation discipline: the perceiver or detector SHALL NOT be silently collapsed into the invited enactor when they differ;
* **(D)** obligation barrier: invitation language SHALL NOT be silently rewritten as duty language;
* **(A/E)** witness discipline for decision/publication/automation lanes;
* **(L/A)** admissible semantic change classes and edition-fence expectations;
* **(A/E)** cross-context / cross-plane policy when reuse is claimed.

Each in-scope occurrence SHALL be representable as a pattern-specific **QualifiedRelationRecord**:

`ActionInvitationRecord :=`
`⟨`
`  relationKind             : actionInvitation,`
`  siteTuple                : …,`
`  siteFacetMap?            : tuple-member ↦ (Object | Description | Carrier),`
`  invitedEnactorTuple      : …,`
`  candidateActionTuple     : …,`
`  actionInvitationSense    : ActionInvitationSense,`
`  couplingFrame            : …,`
`  detector?                : …,`
`  viewpoint?               : U.Viewpoint,`
`  view?                    : U.View,`
`  normalForm               : CuePack | ActionOption | OptionSet | PolicyHook,`
`  articulationHint?        : open-cue | sketched | option-explicit | hook-explicit,`
`  scope?                   : U.Scope,`
`  Γ_time?                  : U.GammaTimePolicy,`
`  representationSubstrate? : ecological-world-coupled | embodied-kinesthetic | latent-distributed | symbolic-local | hybrid,`
`  bridgeRef?               : BridgeId,`
`  witnesses?               : EvidenceRefSet`
`⟩`

So the sentence “X affords Y” is never accepted as a terminal form.
Within the scope of A.6.A it must be rewritten into an explicit `actionInvitation(...)` instance with declared downstream routing; earlier pre-threshold material may instead remain as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed route-bounded upstream publication before A.6.A entry.

**Discipline note.**
`ActionInvitationSense` is a **slot value inside** the relation family; it is not a replacement for the relation family itself.
The stable intermediate lens is the `actionInvitation(...)` relation; the sense token refines **what kind of invitation** is being published.

**A.7 lane note.**
`siteFacetMap` uses only the A.7 lane distinction `Object | Description | Carrier`.
If a `PublicationSurface` / `InteropSurface` participates, declare it separately under **A.7 / L-SURF** rather than widening the lane set with a generic `Surface` token.

**Separation note.**
`detector` and `invitedEnactor` are not synonyms.
When both matter, they SHALL be published separately.

**Enactor note.**
When `invitedEnactorTuple` is published as an actual would-be enactor, it SHALL resolve to a `U.System` or to a role assignment whose holder is a `U.System`. An episteme, description, publication face, or carrier may participate in the **site**, but not as the acting bearer.

**Episteme non-agency note.**
If the site is a Description/Episteme, any later enactment still occurs on carriers and/or target systems; the description itself never acts.
### Core construct: ActionInvitationSense

Every in-scope use SHALL resolve to an explicit **`ActionInvitationSense`** token.

An `ActionInvitationSense` token publishes at least:

`ActionInvitationSense :=`
`⟨`
`  senseId,`
`  siteArity,`
`  enactorArity,`
`  candidateActionArity,`
`  defaultArticulationHint,`
`  admissibleArticulationHints,`
`  defaultRepresentationSubstrate,`
`  admissibleRepresentationSubstrates,`
`  defaultNormalForm,`
`  admissibleNormalForms,`
`  couplingFrameKind,`
`  admissibleEvidenceModes,`
`  admissibleChangeClasses,`
`  bridgePolicy`
`⟩`

Where:

* **`defaultArticulationHint`** and **`admissibleArticulationHints`** use the current local alias set
  `{ open-cue, sketched, option-explicit, hook-explicit }`
* **`defaultRepresentationSubstrate`** ∈
  `{ ecological-world-coupled, embodied-kinesthetic, latent-distributed, symbolic-local, hybrid }`
* **`admissibleRepresentationSubstrates`** explicitly declares the lawful publication substrates for the sense;
* **`defaultNormalForm`** ∈
  `{ CuePack, ActionOption, OptionSet, PolicyHook }`
### A.16 alias-docking note

A.6.A carries `articulationHint` only as a **local alias field**.

This field is deliberately **not** a new formality ladder, **not** a maturity scale, and **not** a surrogate for **F**. Its only job is to preserve local articulation / closure cues until they are docked to `A.16` move logic and the explicit `C.2.4` / `C.2.5` facet owners.

Local `articulationHint` tokens SHALL dock to `A.16` move logic and to the explicit `C.2.4` / `C.2.5` facet owners one-for-one, and A.6.A SHALL treat them as aliases or publication conveniences only.
Until then, local hints SHALL NOT be thresholded, aggregated, or compared across Contexts.
### Normative starter set of sense families

A Context MAY add local senses, but the following starter set is normative as the initial disambiguation menu:

| `ActionInvitationSense` token | Use when the action-first phrase means…                                                     |            Default normal form | Typical substrate                                    | Must **not** be silently collapsed into                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AIS.PhysicalAffordance`      | a material/environmental configuration offers a bodily action to an embodied agent          |    `CuePack` or `ActionOption` | `ecological-world-coupled` or `embodied-kinesthetic` | object property alone, generic capability, executed work |
| `AIS.InterfaceAffordance`     | an interface face, operator panel, alarm, or publication face presents an operator move | `ActionOption` or `PolicyHook` | `symbolic-local` or `hybrid`                         | duty/commitment, execution log                           |
| `AIS.SocialAffordance`        | another agent or social situation invites a response or coordination move                   |    `CuePack` or `ActionOption` | `embodied-kinesthetic` or `hybrid`                   | role assignment itself, deontic commitment               |
| `AIS.EpistemicProbe`          | a problem situation invites asking, contrasting, measuring, testing, or instrumenting       |  `ActionOption` or `OptionSet` | `hybrid`                                             | explanatory merit, evidence claim, finished method       |
| `AIS.ClosureAdvance`          | a situation invites naming, rescoping, proxy declaration, or formalization toward closure   |                 `ActionOption` | `symbolic-local` or `hybrid`                         | Formality **F**, acceptance status, quality ascription   |
| `AIS.LatentPolicyCue`         | a learned/distributed state carries an action-oriented tendency not yet locally articulated |       `CuePack` or `OptionSet` | `latent-distributed` or `hybrid`                     | explicit rationale, control adequacy, quality score      |
| `AIS.ControlOpportunity`      | a closed-loop state invites brake / rollback / replan / isolate / escalate / override       |    `OptionSet` or `PolicyHook` | `hybrid`                                             | bare “model wants”, obligation, work occurrence          |

**Normative rewrite note.**

* In **ecological / embodied** contexts, bare *affords* SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.PhysicalAffordance`** unless another sense is explicitly declared.
* In **interface / alarm / operator-panel** contexts, bare action-first phrasing SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.InterfaceAffordance`** and/or **`AIS.ControlOpportunity`**.
* In **epistemic exploration** contexts, “this suggests probing / formalizing / reframing” SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.EpistemicProbe`** and/or **`AIS.ClosureAdvance`**.
* In **learned world-model / active-inference / policy** contexts, bare “the model wants / the state suggests” SHALL rewrite to **`AIS.LatentPolicyCue`** and/or **`AIS.ControlOpportunity`**, with the distinction made explicit.
* If the sentence is chiefly about **better / worse / fit / merit**, use **A.6.Q** instead of A.6.A.
### Required slots for a conforming actionInvitation

A conforming `actionInvitation` SHALL make explicit:

1. **Site tuple and site-facet docking.**
   What the invitation is *about*: object, scene, interface object, description, carrier, episode, or control state — with per-member A.7 lane annotations when the tuple is mixed.

2. **Invited enactor tuple.**
   Which system / collective system / role-holder is invited to act.

3. **Candidate action tuple.**
   What action is being invited.

4. **`ActionInvitationSense`.**
   Which action-oriented family is intended.

5. **Coupling frame.**
   The relation-basis under which the invitation is published.
   Examples: reach envelope, interface state, incident horizon, control horizon, probe pack, open issue set.

6. **Detector and/or viewpoint.**
   Who or what detected the cue, and under which viewpoint it is published.

7. **Normal form and `articulationHint`.**
   How the invitation is published and how far it has been articulated.

8. **Scope and time when relevant.**
   `U.Scope` and `Γ_time` SHALL be explicit when omission changes meaning.

9. **Representation substrate when relevant.**
   Especially when comparing ecological, embodied, latent-distributed, and symbolic-local treatments.

10. **Witness / evidence mode.**
    Exemplars, sensory traces, probe notes, kinematic data, interface events, controller traces, run logs, or review notes.
### Normal-form discipline

An `ActionInvitationSense` SHALL declare one lawful default normal form and MAY declare additional admissible normal forms explicitly.

**Docking note.**
Where a published invitation already points to executable artifacts, the record SHOULD reuse existing `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` / `U.WorkPlan` identifiers or refs. `PolicyHook` SHALL always be a hook over pre-existing gate / method / protocol surfaces; it does not mint a new execution, admissibility, or deontic ontology.

**ANF-1 — `CuePack`.**
Use for early or weakly articulated invitations, especially `AIS.PhysicalAffordance`, `AIS.SocialAffordance`, and many cases of `AIS.LatentPolicyCue`.

A conforming `CuePack` publishes:

* exemplar or contrast episodes, sensory traces, or probe cues,
* site conditions,
* enactor profile or enactor constraints,
* a small gloss set of candidate actions,
* optional ordinal urgency or salience summaries,
* explicit warning that the cue is **not yet** a commitment, a selected method, a gate, or work,
* explicit note that witness-bearing does **not** by itself make the hinted action correct, required, or selected.

**ANF-2 — `ActionOption`.**
Use when one candidate action tuple is explicit.

A conforming `ActionOption` publishes:

* one candidate action tuple,
* invited enactor / role,
* local guard sketch,
* expected near-field effect,
* optional `U.Method` / `U.MethodDescription` / `U.WorkPlan` refs when those already exist in-context,
* explicit note that the option is **not yet selected**, **not yet obligatory**, and **not yet executed**.

**ANF-3 — `OptionSet`.**
Use when several candidate actions coexist.

A conforming `OptionSet` publishes:

* explicit action members,
* any local comparator, triage rule, or partial order,
* admissible incomparability if no total order is lawful,
* prohibition on hidden scalarisation.

**ANF-4 — `PolicyHook`.**
Use when the invitation is explicitly bound to an existing controller, gate, playbook, method, or override protocol.

A conforming `PolicyHook` publishes:

* referenced policy / method / gate / protocol ids (pre-existing owners only),
* applicable guard or trigger conditions,
* ownership / accountable role,
* escalation or override references when relevant,
* explicit note that the hook is a **binding surface** over existing semantics, not itself a commitment, an admissibility law, or a work occurrence.
### Separation from quality, capability, commitment, and work

A.6.A SHALL prevent the collapse of action invitation language into neighbouring families.

* A statement about **better / worse / fit / merit** belongs to **A.6.Q**.
* A statement about **what a system can do in general** belongs to capability / method description.
* A statement about **what must be done** belongs to **A.6.B** (`A-*` / `D-*`).
* A statement about **what was actually done** belongs to **A.15 / U.Work**.
* If an invitation targets a description/episteme, any later enactment still occurs on symbol carriers and/or target systems; the description itself never acts.
* Mixed sentences that carry both evaluative and invitational content SHALL be split into `evaluativeAscription(...)` and `actionInvitation(...)` records, with explicit cross-references when the co-occurrence matters.

Mixed sentences SHALL be split.

Examples:

* “This scene is good for grasping” may require **both** `evaluativeAscription(...)` and `actionInvitation(...)`.
* “This alarm requires rollback” is **not** a lawful final affordance record; it needs explicit gate / duty routing.
* “The robot can grasp this handle” is a capability claim unless the situated site/actor/frame and invitation are made explicit.
* “The operator clicked rollback” is work, not invitation.
### Bridge discipline across traditions

Whenever two traditions are compared using action-first language, the author SHALL publish an explicit **bridge stance** and loss note.

Allowed bridge stances:

* **`localRename`**
* **`operationalizes`**
* **`partialAnalogy`**
* **`projection`**
* **`nonEquivalent`**

Examples:

* `AIS.PhysicalAffordance` - `AIS.InterfaceAffordance` is usually `partialAnalogy`, not identity.
* `AIS.EpistemicProbe` - `AIS.ClosureAdvance` is usually a progression-by-closure relation, not identity.
* `AIS.LatentPolicyCue` > `AIS.ControlOpportunity` is often `operationalizes` or `projection`.
* `AIS.PhysicalAffordance` > `PolicyHook` in robotics is usually `projection` under a controller frame.
* Action invitation and quality ascription may co-occur, but co-occurrence is **not** identity.
### Change lexicon

A conforming pattern SHALL narrate changes with a stable change lexicon aligned to A.6.P:

* **`declareActionInvitation(...)`** — create a new explicit action invitation record.
* **`withdrawActionInvitation(...)`** — retire a prior record.
* **`retargetSite(...)`** — change the site tuple while keeping the same relation family.
* **`retargetInvitedEnactor(...)`** — change the invited enactor tuple when that slot is ref-backed.
* **`reviseAction(...)`** — change the candidate action tuple by value (or split into the corresponding `retargetParticipant(...)` form if the local contract makes the action slot ref-backed).
* **`reviseSense(...)`** — change the value in the `actionInvitationSense` slot.
* **`reArticulate(...)`** — change the `articulationHint` while preserving sense family.
* **`reFrame(...)`** — change coupling frame.
* **`reGuard(...)`** — change guard sketch or hook condition.
* **`rePolicyHook(...)`** — change policy / gate / method hook details.
* **`reView(...)`** — change detector / viewpoint / view publication.
* **`rescope(...)`** — change `U.Scope`.
* **`retime(...)`** — change `Γ_time`.
* **`refreshWitnesses(...)`** — refresh witness bindings.
* **`changeRelationKind(...)`** — semantic move to a different relation family; never edit in place silently.

A silent move from invitation to commitment, capability, or work is a breaking semantic change.

**A.6.P rewrite note.**
`retargetSite(...)` and `retargetInvitedEnactor(...)` are family-specific refinements of participant retargeting and SHALL be used only when the corresponding slots are ref-backed. `reviseAction(...)`, `reviseSense(...)`, `reArticulate(...)`, `reFrame(...)`, `reGuard(...)`, and `rePolicyHook(...)` are by-value revisions unless the local contract explicitly declares the corresponding slot as ref-backed, in which case the text SHALL use the matching `retargetParticipant(...)` form. This preserves A.6.5’s ref-vs-value discipline.
### A.6.B routing template for actionInvitation

When an action invitation becomes boundary-bearing, route it explicitly:

* **L** — `actionInvitation` contract skeleton, `ActionInvitationSense` semantics, normal-form lawfulness, actor/site discipline, bridge stances.
* **A** — admissibility conditions for using the invitation in selector, triage, automation, or publication lanes.
* **D** — duties on authors, operators, or owners: lexical firewall, naming the invited actor, naming the hook owner, naming override paths where required.
* **E** — carrier-anchored witnesses: sensory traces, interface events, probe notes, controller logs, run traces, incident records.

Do not let bare action-first language carry L/A/D/E force by itself.
### Lexical guardrails

In **Tech / normative prose**:

* bare **affords / invites / calls for / actionable / ready for / ripe for / natural next step / the model wants / the interface tells** MUST NOT appear without immediate repair;
* **actionable insight** MUST be rewritten to `ActionOption` / `OptionSet` / `PolicyHook`, or to **A.6.Q** if the use is primarily evaluative;
* **affordance** MUST NOT be treated as a monadic property of an object without actor, site, and frame;
* an invitation MUST NOT be presented as if it were already a duty, gate, or work occurrence;
* a latent policy cue MUST NOT be presented as if it were already an explanation;
* `articulationHint` MUST NOT be read as **F**, as acceptance status, or as a replacement for `A.16` anchors;
* generic `Surface` facet tokens MUST NOT be introduced inside A.6.A; publication-surface participation must be declared under **A.7 / L-SURF**, not by widening the A.7 lane set;
* hidden enactor language inside adjectives such as *graspable*, *deployable*, *actionable*, *ready* SHALL be unpacked;
* quoted metalinguistic uses are allowed, but SHALL be marked as token-under-discussion.
### Progressive elaboration

A.6.A supports monotone elaboration:

1. Start by selecting an `ActionInvitationSense` and recording rival candidates when ambiguity is live.
2. Declare site, would-be enactor, action, frame, and site-facet docking.
3. Choose a lawful normal form and a local `articulationHint` when omission would hide articulation state.
4. Add guards, method/policy hooks, and witness bindings.
5. If a `CuePack` / `ActionOption` is projected into `OptionSet` / `PolicyHook` or docked to **A.6.Q** / **A.6.B** / **A.15** surfaces, publish an explicit projection / operationalization note rather than silently upgrading the invitation.
6. Add bridges and loss notes if traditions are compared.
7. If the invitation becomes boundary-bearing, emit `L/A/D/E` routing hooks and, where enactment is implied, route into A.15 surfaces.
8. Never move from invitation into capability, commitment, or work silently.
### Endpoint-first downstream discipline

If a repaired phrase already names a lawful downstream owner such as a gate hook, method surface, work-planning surface, or work occurrence, authors SHOULD publish that owner directly and keep `actionInvitation(...)` only as the preceding repair record when the invitation semantics themselves still matter. `actionInvitation(...)` is therefore a post-threshold invitation record, not a shadow substitute for `A.6.B`, `A.15`, or gate-owner patterns.
## Archetypal Grounding

### Tell

If a draft says *affords*, *calls for*, *invites*, or *actionable*, the author has not yet named the action-oriented family.

A conforming post-threshold rewrite publishes one explicit `actionInvitation(...)` with one `ActionInvitationSense`, one site tuple, one invited enactor tuple, one candidate action tuple, one coupling frame, one normal form, and explicit articulation / scope / time / substrate qualifiers when they matter. Earlier action-guiding material may still remain outside A.6.A as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed route-bounded upstream publication until threshold conditions are met.

## Bias-Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**. Scope: **Universal** for overloaded affordance / action-first language in FPF prose.

* **Gov bias:** this pattern may tempt authors to smuggle decisions into invitation language.
  *Mitigation:* explicit A.6.B routing and obligation barrier.
* **Arch bias:** this pattern prefers one stable relation family over loose action talk.
  *Mitigation:* allow Plain exploratory prose before Tech / normative publication.
* **Onto/Epist bias:** this pattern insists on separating invitation from evaluation, capability, commitment, and work.
  *Mitigation:* explicit bridge stances and mixed-sentence split rules.
* **Prag bias:** it favors enactor/site/action explicitness, which raises authoring cost.
  *Mitigation:* small starter set, normal-form discipline, and copyable rewrites.
* **Did bias:** repeated rewrites make the pattern teachable, but may over-formalize early cues.
  *Mitigation:* `CuePack` and local `articulationHint` keep early stages lawful without pretending closure.
## Conformance Checklist (CC-A.6.A)

A text or pattern conforms to A.6.A iff:

1. **CC-A.6.A-1 — Explicit post-threshold relation family and explicit sense.**
   Every in-scope post-threshold action-first use resolves to one declared `actionInvitation(...)` instance and one declared `ActionInvitationSense`; earlier cue-like material is routed through `A.16.1` / `B.4.1` instead of being forced into A.6.A prematurely.
2. **CC-A.6.A-2 — Explicit site and site-facet docking.**
   The site tuple is explicit; when ambiguous or mixed, the A.7 lane map (`Object | Description | Carrier`) is explicit.

3. **CC-A.6.A-3 — Explicit invited enactor.**
   The invited enactor tuple is explicit.

4. **CC-A.6.A-4 — Enactor discipline.**
   When the invited enactor is meant as the actual would-be enactor, it resolves to a `U.System` or role assignment with system holder.

5. **CC-A.6.A-5 — Explicit candidate action.**
   The candidate action tuple is explicit and reviewable.

6. **CC-A.6.A-6 — Explicit coupling frame.**
   The coupling frame is explicit.

7. **CC-A.6.A-7 — Detector/viewpoint separation.**
   When both matter, `detector` and `viewpoint` are not silently collapsed.

8. **CC-A.6.A-8 — Lawful normal form.**
   The invitation is published as `CuePack`, `ActionOption`, `OptionSet`, or `PolicyHook`, with corresponding discipline observed.

9. **CC-A.6.A-9 — Articulation-hint discipline.**
   If omission changes meaning, `articulationHint` is explicit and is not treated as **F** or as an acceptance state.

10. **CC-A.6.A-10 — No invitation-as-obligation.**
    An invitation is not silently published as a duty or gate.

11. **CC-A.6.A-11 — No invitation-as-work.**
    An invitation is not silently published as a work occurrence.

12. **CC-A.6.A-12 — No capability collapse.**
    A situated invitation is not silently rewritten as a general capability claim.

13. **CC-A.6.A-13 — No object-property collapse.**
    Affordance language is not published as a monadic object property when actor/site/frame matter.

14. **CC-A.6.A-14 — No hidden scalarisation.**
    `OptionSet` publication does not introduce a hidden total score or ranking without an explicit comparator / policy.

15. **CC-A.6.A-15 — No silent sense rewrite.**
    Sense changes use the declared change lexicon.

16. **CC-A.6.A-16 — No silent relation-family switch.**
    Moving from invitation to quality ascription, capability, commitment, or work uses `changeRelationKind(...)` or an explicit split.

17. **CC-A.6.A-17 — Bridge accountability.**
    Cross-tradition parallels publish bridge stance and loss notes.

18. **CC-A.6.A-18 — Boundary-routing hook when needed.**
    If the repaired invitation is used for admissibility, commitments, publication, or automation, downstream `L/A/D/E` hooks are explicit.

19. **CC-A.6.A-19 — Lexical firewall.**
    Bare action-first trigger tokens are absent from Tech / normative prose except as quoted metalinguistic discussion.

20. **CC-A.6.A-20 — `actionInvitation` contract skeleton is published.**
    The family-specific `RelationKind` token resolves to a contract skeleton with SlotSpecs, enactor/site discipline, qualifier expectations, repair paths, witness discipline, admissible change classes, and cross-context policy.

21. **CC-A.6.A-21 — Candidate-Set Note is used when ambiguity is live.**
    If the site lane map, enactor lane, relation family, or sense selection is non-obvious, the text records a short Candidate-Set Note before decision-bearing use.
## Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern                   | Symptom                                                                                     | Why it fails                                           | How to avoid / repair                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Object-property affordance** | “The object is actionable” with no enactor or site frame                                    | collapses relationality into monadic property language | publish site + enactor + action + coupling frame               |
| **Invitation-as-obligation**   | “This calls for rollback” is treated as if rollback is already required                     | hides A/D routing and accountability                   | publish `actionInvitation(...)`, then route duty/gate via A.6.B |
| **Invitation-as-work**         | “The system reacted” is used where only a cue or option exists                              | confuses offer with execution                          | keep invitation separate from A.15 / `U.Work`                   |
| **Capability-as-invitation**   | “The robot can do X” stands in for a situated affordance                                    | destroys local enactor/site conditions                 | separate capability description from action invitation          |
| **Latent cue as explanation**  | a model tendency is narrated as if it were already an explicit rationale                    | overstates articulation and evidence                   | keep as `CuePack` or `OptionSet` until further articulation     |
| **Premature automation**       | a weak cue is wired directly into gates or controllers with no explicit hook owner or guard | creates unsafe action pathways                         | require `PolicyHook` + A.6.B routing + witnesses                |
| **ArticulationHint as F proxy**| `hook-explicit` is read as “more formal”                                                    | recreates a forbidden second formality ladder          | keep F in C.2.3; reserve articulation/closure semantics for `A.16` |
## Consequences

**Benefits.**
This pattern gives FPF a lawful **post-threshold repair record family** for **action-first** discourse. It lets embodied, ecological, latent, interface, and control cues be published without pretending they are already commitments, capabilities, metrics, or work.

It also complements A.6.Q cleanly: A.6.Q repairs **evaluative** ambiguity, while A.6.A repairs **action-inviting** ambiguity.

**Trade-offs / mitigations.**
The pattern adds authoring overhead and can feel heavy in early exploration.

Mitigation: allow bare action-first language in Plain exploratory notes, but require repair before it enters Tech / normative, boundary, automation, assurance, or publication surfaces.
## Rationale

A.6.A makes one strategic move:

> **Affordance / action-first language is not treated as a monadic property and not treated as a hidden duty. It is treated as a family of action invitations whose members differ by site, actor, candidate action, coupling frame, substrate, and lawful publication form.**

This bridge reading is intentionally neutral: in ecological settings the site is **not** treated as a literal speaker or norm-giver. “Invitation” is the stable publishable FPF lens for situated opportunity-to-act talk, not a claim that all source traditions use that word or share one ontology.

This gives FPF a lawful path for:

* ecological and embodied affordances,
* interface and operator prompts,
* epistemic “probe this / formalize this / reframe this” moves,
* latent policy cues in learned systems,
* control opportunities in closed loops,

without forcing them into one false universal vocabulary.

It also keeps the larger architecture clean:

* **A.6.Q** owns evaluative repairs,
* **A.6.A** owns action-invitation repairs,
* **A.6.B** owns boundary routing,
* **A.15** owns enactment / work,
* **A.16** owns articulation / closure progression and lawful moves,
* **C.2.3** remains the sole owner of the formality axis **F**.
## SoTA-Echoing

Recent philosophical and ecological work treats affordances as **action-relevant possibilities** perceived in engagement and, in some accounts, as **invitations for action**, rather than as viewpoint-free monadic object properties. A.6.A adopts that relational, action-first stance, adapts it by forcing explicit `siteTuple` / `invitedEnactorTuple` / `couplingFrame` publication, and rejects silent collapse into monadic object labels. ([Frontiers][1], [Springer][2])

Recent empirical review work on affordance perception emphasises **attunement and recalibration** in person-plus-object systems rather than fixed, context-free labels. A.6.A adopts the need for actor- and situation-specific publication, adapts it into `CuePack` / `ActionOption` / `OptionSet` normal forms, and rejects any assumption that an affordance phrase is already a lawful metric or a universally portable invariant. ([Springer][2])

Current active-inference work frames generative models as supporting **action-perception loops** and, in many cases, **action-oriented models** that are for adaptive interaction rather than only detached description. A.6.A adopts the action-oriented emphasis and the separation between model-side cueing and enacted action; it adapts this by making `detector` and `invitedEnactor` explicit and by forbidding latent policy cues from counting as work, commitment, or explicit rationale by default. ([UCL Discovery][3])

Current robotics work increasingly uses affordances as **intermediate representations** between perception/language and low-level action, including compact keypoint or staged affordance plans. A.6.A adopts this as evidence that affordance publication can be a lawful intermediate publication form; it adapts it into `ActionOption`, `OptionSet`, and `PolicyHook`, and rejects silent promotion of such representations into deontic obligation, proof of correctness, or objective value. ([Robotics: Science and Systems][4])

**Coverage note.**
This section already covers the load-bearing relational/action-oriented stance. A fuller canonical corpus package should also bind explicit operator-interaction / operator-alarm / incident-response SoTA-pack material so that operator-facing interface practice is evidenced as directly as the current ecology / active-inference / robotics branch.
## Relations

* **Specialises:** **A.6.P** as an RPR pattern for overloaded affordance / action-first language.
* **Builds on:** **A.3/A.7** for enactor discipline and Object≠Description≠Carrier separation; **A.15** for keeping invitation distinct from enactment; **A.6.B** for boundary routing; **E.17/E.18** for viewpoint publication.
* **Works alongside:** **A.6.Q** for evaluative language; the two are siblings, not substitutes.
* **Coordinates with:** **C.2.2a / A.16 / A.16.1 / A.16.2 / B.4.1** for language-state chart positions, lawful moves before post-threshold repair, and retreat when a published invitation must be reopened; use **A.16.0** only when lineage, branch, loss, or handoff history itself must be published as an explicit trajectory account; **B.5.2.0** for probe-question cases that are still prompt-shaped; **C.2.LS / C.2.4 / C.2.5 / C.2.6 / C.2.7** for language-state facet ownership.
* **Must not replace:** **C.2.3** as the single owner of **F**.
* **Recommends publication via:** **E.10 / F.17 / F.18** when `actionInvitation` tokens, starter senses, and red-flag rewrites become shared vocabulary.

### Language-space refactor note

This pattern is scoped to **action-invitation repair and routing**, not to the whole early cue layer. Early action-guiding material may remain in `A.16.1` as cue-pack content, a `RoutedCueSet`, or another typed route-bounded upstream publication before it stabilizes into `actionInvitation(...)`.
### Canonical downstream seam

`actionInvitation(...)` should route canonically through `A.6.B` and `A.15` toward gates, commitments, methods, or work. Operator-facing starter senses such as `AIS.AlertInterventionCue` or `AIS.OperatorInterventionCue` should not be buried under generic `AIS.InterfaceAffordance` when human factors and policy hooks materially differ.
### Ownership boundary

Bridge stances, articulation-state owners, and language-state facet axes are **referenced** by this pattern but remain owned by `F.9.1`, `A.16`, `C.2.LS`, `C.2.4`, `C.2.5`, `C.2.6`, and `C.2.7`.
