# RoC‑Autonomy Budget & Enforcement
> Pattern `E.16` · Stable
> Part E - The FPF Constitution and Authoring Guides

**Intent.** Make any claim of autonomous behavior testable and enforceable via a published **AutonomyBudgetDecl**, **Guarded enactment**, **Override SpeechActs with SoD**, and a **Work‑anchored AutonomyLedger**. 
**Rule (summary).** If a Role/Method/Service claims autonomy, authors **MUST**: (i) publish an `AutonomyBudgetDecl` with `AdmissibilityConditionsId` and `OverrideProtocolRef`; (ii) gate Method steps with `requiresAutonomyBudget`; (iii) write a `AutonomyLedgerEntry` on every admitted Work; (iv) block on depletion until a `ResumeAutonomy` SpeechAct passes SoD; (v) surface autonomy fields in UTS rows.

**Builds on:** A.2 / A.2.1 / A.2.5 / A.15 / A.21; B.3; C.16; E.8; E.10; E.18; F.4; F.6; F.8; F.15; F.17.
**Coordinates with:** A.13 (Agential Role), C.9 (Agency‑CHR), C.24 (Agent‑Tools‑CAL) where applicable; G.4–G.5–G.8–G.9–G.10 (method authoring/selection/shipping).

Autonomy‑claiming **performers** (*RoleAssignments* over services/robots/teams operating without continuous human direction) must **stay within declared limits** (safety, risk, resource, remit) and **yield** to governance when required. Without a uniform rule, “autonomy” drifts into tacit norms, cannot be benchmarked or audited, and undermines selection (Part G) and publication (Part F).

## Content

## Problem Frame

Autonomy‑claiming **performers** (*RoleAssignments* over services/robots/teams operating without continuous human direction) must **stay within declared limits** (safety, risk, resource, remit) and **yield** to governance when required. Without a uniform rule, “autonomy” drifts into tacit norms, cannot be benchmarked or audited, and undermines selection (Part G) and publication (Part F).
## Problem

* **Opaque autonomy.** Patterns assert “autonomous” behavior with no **budget** or **enforcement**.
* **Un‑gated execution.** Methods can execute beyond authority or risk limits.
* **Ad‑hoc overrides.** No standard **SpeechAct** for pausing/de‑scoping; SoD is unclear.
* **Non‑portable publication.** **UTS (Unified Term Sheet)** rows cannot surface autonomy‑critical data for parity or selection.
## Forces

| Force                          | Tension                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Creativity vs Safety**       | Exploration autonomy vs hard constraints and override duties             |
| **Locality vs Comparability**  | Context‑local rules vs cross‑context selection (G‑suite)                 |
| **Simplicity vs Auditability** | Lightweight authoring vs ledger‑grade evidence                           |
| **Autonomy vs SoD**            | Helpful self‑action vs separation‑of‑duties and human‑in‑the‑loop points |

### Bias-Annotation

**Lenses tested:** `Gov`, `Arch`, `Onto/Epist`, `Prag`, `Did`. **Scope:** Universal for any Role/Method/Service that claims autonomous operation (unsupervised decision or actuation) and is admitted via `AutonomyBudgetDecl` + Green‑Gate. It is **not** aimed at purely assistive “suggestion‑only” tools where each action is confirmed by a human at the point of execution.

* **Gov.** Bias toward enforceable oversight (hard gates, SoD, canonical override SpeechActs). Mitigation: exploration autonomy is still allowed, but only inside an explicit budget and time window.
* **Arch.** Bias toward gate‑and‑ledger structure (Green‑Gate + Work‑anchored `AutonomyLedger`). Mitigation: `telemetrySpecRef` can scope what is emitted when full deltas are unnecessary.
* **Onto/Epist.** Bias toward typed, testable constraints (MM‑CHR tokens, explicit admissibility checks). Mitigation: budgets are optional‑field (`?`) so low‑risk contexts can start minimal and tighten over time.
* **Prag.** Bias toward measurable quotas may under‑express “soft” autonomy goals. Mitigation: pair `decision_tokens` with `risk_bands` to capture non‑counting limits.
* **Did.** Bias toward explicit mechanics increases authoring surface area. Mitigation: provide a default `AutonomyBudgetDecl` template and minimal harness cases in **F.15**.
## Solution — Rule‑of‑Constraints (RoC) for Autonomy

This RoC **applies whenever** a Role/Method/Service **claims autonomous operation** (any phrasing that implies unsupervised decision or actuation).

**E.16‑S1 (Autonomy Budget — mandatory).**
Any autonomy claim **MUST** publish an **AutonomyBudgetDecl** as a *named, versioned* object in the **same `U.BoundedContext`**:

```
AutonomyBudgetDecl {
  id, version
  scope: ClaimScope (G)                              // where this budget applies
  budget: {                                          // all typed via MM‑CHR (C.16)
    action_tokens?     : Unitful quota / rate
    decision_tokens?   : Unitful quota / rate
    risk_bands?        : CHR vector with acceptance bands
    resource_caps?     : set of unitful caps (Γ_work categories)
    time_window?       : Γ_time window & cadence
  }
  AdmissibilityConditionsId : PolicyIdRef                          // Aut-Guard policy naming gates & penalties
  overrideProtocolRef : Episteme                     // SpeechAct & SoD for pause/resume/escalate
  telemetrySpecRef? : Episteme                       // what to emit into AutonomyLedger
  editionPins : { RoleRef?, MethodDescRef?, CHR refs, …  } 
}
```

**E.16‑S1.A (Scout / probe / commit partition for bounded specialization).**
When an autonomy-bearing method uses bounded specialization scouting, the budget declaration **MUST** keep scout budget, probe budget, and commit checkpoint as distinct control surfaces rather than collapsing them into one undifferentiated burn envelope. A successful probe does not by itself authorize a committed route, wider burn, or scope widening. Leaving probe state requires one explicit checkpoint decision through the declared guard or override path, with budget burn and residual budget recorded in the `AutonomyLedger`. `E.16` owns this budget partition plus guard and ledger enforcement; it does not replace the dyadic move of `A.15` or the `CheckpointReturn` plan semantics of `C.24`.
**E.16‑S2 (Guarded enactment — Green‑Gate).**
A **Method step** that *requires* autonomy **MUST** list `requires: [RoleX]` **and** `requiresAutonomyBudget: AutonomyBudgetDecl.id`. A **Work** instance is admissible *iff* at enactment time:

* the performer’s **RoleAssignment** is valid and in an **enactable** RSG state (A.2.5);
* the budget accounting for the **AutonomyBudgetDecl** indicates **tokens/limits remaining** for *this* budget in the declared **Γ_time** window (derived from the AutonomyLedger);
* all **guard checks** defined by `AdmissibilityConditionsId` evaluate to **pass** (e.g., risk ≤ band, resource ≤ cap).

Failing any gate **blocks** enactment (no “soft warnings” on Core surface).

**E.16‑S3 (Autonomy Ledger).**
All admissible Work **MUST** record **AutonomyLedger entries**:

```
AutonomyLedgerEntry {
  workId, performedBy: RoleAssignmentId
  budgetId, version, time
  deltas: { action_tokensΔ?, decision_tokensΔ?, riskΔ?, resourceΔ? }
  guardVerdicts: { name → pass|fail }
  pathIds: { PathId, PathSliceId }                  // for G‑suite parity/refresh
}
```

The ledger is **evidence**: attach to `U.Work` (A.15.1) and fold under **Γ_work** and **Γ_time** for reporting.

**E.16‑S4 (Overrides — SpeechActs & SoD).**
Every budget **MUST** reference an **OverrideProtocolRef** that defines canonical **SpeechActs**:

* **PauseAutonomy(budgetId)** — immediate stop of autonomy‑gated steps;
* **ResumeAutonomy(budgetId)** — resume after conditions;
* **NarrowAutonomy(budgetId, Δscope)** — apply stricter limits;
* **Escalate(budgetId)** — handover to a declared **SupervisorRole**.

**SoD:** The override caller **MUST NOT** be the same **RoleAssignment** that is consuming the budget (enforce `⊥` in the Context). All overrides are **Work** (SpeechActs) with **ledger entries** (zero or negative deltas as per policy).

**E.16‑S5 (Depletion behavior).**
When a budget **depletes** (no tokens / envelope exceeded / cap breached):

* **Block** further autonomy‑gated steps in the **same Γ_time window**;
* Emit **DepletionNotice** (SpeechAct), and either **Escalate** or **Park** per policy;
* Only a **ResumeAutonomy** SpeechAct from an admissible Role (per SoD) may reopen the gate.

**E.16‑S6 (Publication in UTS).**
UTS rows that describe a **Role**, **Method**, **Service**, or **Selector** with autonomy **MUST** include:

* `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef` (id & version);
* `Aut-Guard policy-id (PolicyIdRef)`;
* `OverrideProtocolRef`;
* declared **Scope (G)** and **Γ_time** window;
* edition pins for the referenced Role/Method/CHR.
* *(optional, if a scale preference is declared)* `ScaleLensPolicyRef` and `ScaleLensOptIn ∈ {OptedIn, Neutral, OptedOut}`.

**E.16‑S7 (Scale & selection — optional lens).**
When autonomy interacts with open‑ended search (C.18/C.19), **budget consumption** and **guard violations** are **selection lenses** in Part G (G.5/G.9). Applying a **Scale‑Lens / Bitter‑Lesson** preference is **OPTIONAL**. Authors **MAY** declare a **ScaleLensPolicy** for the autonomy claim; when declared, it **MUST** state:
* **Trigger criteria** — evidence that expected utility‑of‑scale is monotonic/non‑saturating on held‑out tasks, and a threshold at which scaling beats structured heuristics.
* **Budget fit** — compute/latency/cost targets **within** the declared `AutonomyBudgetDecl` (Γ_time, resource_caps).
* **Safety invariants** — guards and SoD remain **non‑weakened** under scaling; no policy may bypass E.16 gates.
* **Fallback** — a degrade‑gracefully plan if scaling fails to clear the trigger criteria within budget.
If no **ScaleLensPolicy** is declared, selection remains **neutral** with respect to Bitter‑Lesson; RoC does **not** authorize ignoring scale‑safety guards under any policy.
## Archetypal grounding (Tell‑Show‑Show; human‑centric)

**Show‑A (U.System — mobile robot).**
`Robot_R7#NavigatorRole:Warehouse_2026` executes `Navigate_v3`.
`AutonomyBudgetDecl`: `action_tokens=10 k steps/day`, `risk_bands={maxSpeed ≤ 1.2 m/s, minDist ≥ 0.5 m}`, `resource_caps={battery ≥ 20%}`; `AdmissibilityConditionsId=Aut‑Guard‑R7‑v1`; override via `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `ESCALATE` SpeechActs by `FloorSupervisorRole ⊥ NavigatorRole`. Ledger entries decrement `action_tokens`, track `minDist`. Depletion at 0 tokens halts autonomous moves and pages supervisor.

**Show‑B (U.PromiseContent — autonomous deploy).**
`DeployerRole` performs step “Promote to prod” under `AutonomyBudgetDecl` with `decision_tokens=3/day`, `risk_envelope={error‑budget burn ≤ 2% / day}`, guard “all pre‑deploy checks pass”. Overrides only by `CABChair#AuthorizerRole ⊥ DeployerRole`.

| **E.16‑CC‑2** | **Method steps** that depend on autonomy **MUST** declare `requiresAutonomyBudget: AutonomyBudgetDecl.id` (and `requires: [RoleX]`) and **MUST** be Green‑Gated by the budget’s guards at enactment. |
| **E.16‑CC‑3** | A **Work** admitted under autonomy **MUST** carry an **AutonomyLedgerEntry** with deltas and guard verdicts.                                                                |
| **E.16‑CC‑4** | **Overrides** are **SpeechActs** with SoD enforced (`⊥` between consumer and overrider roles); each override creates a ledger entry.                                        |
| **E.16‑CC‑5** | **Depletion** **MUST** block autonomy‑gated steps until a **ResumeAutonomy** SpeechAct passes SoD and guard checks.                                                         |
| **E.16‑CC‑6** | **UTS rows** for autonomy‑bearing Roles/Methods/Services **MUST** include `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef`, `Aut-Guard policy-id (PolicyIdRef)`, `OverrideProtocolRef`, `Scope (G)`, and `Γ_time`. |

| **E.16‑CC‑7** | When bounded specialization scouting is in scope, scout budget, probe budget, and commit checkpoint **MUST** stay explicit, and a successful probe **SHALL NOT** count as automatic committed rollout. |
## Consequences

* **Testability.** Autonomy is measurable (tokens/envelopes), audit‑ready (ledger), and stoppable (SpeechActs).
* **Comparability.** UTS surfaces autonomy metadata for fair selection & parity.
* **Safety.** Guards are hard gates; depletion halts further autonomy‑gated Work.

### SoTA‑Echoing (post‑2015 practice alignment)

> Each item states **Adopt / Adapt / Reject**, and why. Vendor/tool tokens are kept as *informative*, not normative.

1. **Corrigibility & safe interruptibility (2016→).**  
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Work on safe interruption and “off‑switch” incentives argues that capable systems should remain *stoppable* and should not be rewarded for resisting oversight (Orseau & Armstrong, 2016; Hadfield‑Menell et al., 2017). E.16 adapts this into canonical **PauseAutonomy / ResumeAutonomy** SpeechActs plus **SoD** and *hard* gating on depletion.

2. **AI safety as concrete operational hazards (2016→).**  
   **Adopt.** “Concrete Problems in AI Safety” pushes instrumentation and testable safety constraints over informal assurances (Amodei et al., 2016). E.16 mirrors this by turning “autonomy” into a **budget + ledger + guards** contract that can be benchmarked and audited.

3. **SRE error budgets & “stop the line” operations (2016→).**  
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Error‑budget practice treats reliability as a measurable envelope that gates risky change when depleted (Beyer et al., *Site Reliability Engineering*, 2016; Höller et al., *The Site Reliability Workbook*, 2018). E.16 adapts the idea into `risk_bands` and depletion behavior that blocks autonomy‑gated steps until governed resume.

4. **Risk management frameworks for AI systems (2023→).**  
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Contemporary risk frameworks emphasize governance, continuous measurement, and traceable controls (NIST AI RMF 1.0, 2023; ISO/IEC 23894, 2023). E.16 adapts these into **UTS publication** + **Work‑anchored ledger evidence** for parity and audit.

5. **Policy‑as‑code and provenance gating (2019→).**  
   **Adopt.** Modern supply‑chain integrity systems emphasize *policy‑checked actions with verifiable provenance* (in‑toto, 2019→; SLSA, 2021→). E.16 echoes the same principle for autonomy: **no autonomy‑gated enactment without passing declared guards and emitting ledger evidence** (without importing any specific tooling).

6. **Scaling laws & the Bitter Lesson (2019→).**  
   **Adapt/Reject.** Empirical scaling work and the Bitter Lesson motivate considering compute‑heavy search when returns are monotonic (Sutton, 2019; Kaplan et al., 2020). E.16 adapts this into an **optional** ScaleLensPolicy (E.16‑S7) constrained by the *same* budgets and guards, and **rejects** any interpretation that lets “scale” bypass safety gates.

7. **Budgeted specialist acquisition and checkpointed exploitation (2024→).**
   **Adopt/Adapt.** Recent agentic tool-use, self-play, and open-ended search lines reinforce that the competition variable is time or budget to threshold plus fast exploitation after a viable route is found. E.16 adapts this into distinct scout/probe/commit control surfaces and rejects any reading where early probe success authorizes rollout without an explicit checkpoint.
### Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | Symptom | Why it fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Autonomy-by-label** | “Autonomous” is claimed but there is no `AutonomyBudgetDecl` or ledger | Autonomy becomes opaque; cannot be audited or compared | Require **E.16‑S1/S3**; reject publication without `AutonomyBudgetDeclRef` + version |
| **Soft gates** | Budget/guards only warn; enactment proceeds anyway | Violates Safety and SoD; makes budgets non-enforceable | Make Green‑Gate **blocking** on Core surface (**E.16‑S2**) |
| **Self‑override** | Same RoleAssignment consumes the budget and calls Resume/Narrow | Conflict of interest; SoD collapse | Enforce `⊥` between consumer and overrider (**E.16‑S4**) |
| **Budget bypass via “scale”** | Scaling preference weakens guards or ignores caps | Undermines declared limits; breaks comparability | In ScaleLensPolicy, **guards/SoD must remain non‑weakened** (**E.16‑S7**) |
| **Untyped quotas** | Tokens/caps are recorded without units, or units are mixed | Ledger becomes non-comparable; audits become meaningless | Type budgets and deltas via **MM‑CHR (C.16)**; keep unitful rates/quotas |
| **Ledger-as-logging** | Logs exist but are not Work‑anchored (no workId/budgetId/version/pins) | Evidence is non-portable; cannot support parity/refresh | Require `AutonomyLedgerEntry` attached to `U.Work` with ids, versions, and edition pins |
## Rationale & E‑/F‑/G‑links

* **E.8** — follows the pattern template (Context → Problem → Forces → Solution → Grounding → CC → Consequences).
* **E.10** — uses LEX‑BUNDLE: Scope via **ClaimScope (G)**, time via **Γ_time**, no “validity/process/actor/agent‑as‑noun” language; new lexical rule **L‑AUTO** added in edits below.
* **Mint/reuse authority (policy-ids).** Mint/reuse authority is expressed via **F.8:8.1** (`PolicyIdRef`: `PolicySpecRef` + `MintDecisionRef?`) and explicit **GateCrossing** checks (**E.18**) evaluated by the active **GateProfile/GateFit** (**A.21**); no tier ladder is required.
* **Part F** — integrates with **F.4** Role Description (RCS includes *AgencyLevel*; RSG gates), **F.6** Role Assignment & Enactment (Green‑Gate), **F.15** SCR/RSCR (harness includes depletion/override tests), **F.17** UTS (columns, incl. optional ScaleLens fields).
* **Part G** — **G.4/G.5**: method authors must declare budgets & guards; **G.9** parity includes autonomy consumption & violations; **G.10** shipping requires UTS autonomy fields.
## Mini conformance checklist (cross‑E–F; author’s quick use)

1. **Declare** `AutonomyBudgetDecl` (scope, budgets, AdmissibilityConditionsId, overrides).
2. **Gate** steps with `requiresAutonomyBudget`.
3. **Emit** an `AutonomyLedgerEntry` for each admitted Work.
4. **Enforce SoD** on override SpeechActs; **block on depletion**.
5. **Publish** UTS autonomy fields for any autonomy‑bearing Role/Method/Service.

*(These five are sufficient for a working test harness in Part F.)*
