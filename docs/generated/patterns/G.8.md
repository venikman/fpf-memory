# SoS-LOG Bundles & Maturity Ladders
> Pattern `G.8` · Stable
> Part G - Discipline SoTA Patterns Kit

**Tag.** Architectural pattern (packaging kit).
**Stage.** Design‑time packaging (authoring & publication) with a run‑time consumption facade for `G.5` (selector/registry).
**Primary hooks:** `G.Core` (Part‑G invariants), `C.23` (SoS‑LOG semantics), `C.22` (TaskSignature), `G.4` (Acceptance & EvidenceProfiles), `G.6` (EvidenceGraph & `PathId/PathSliceId`), `G.5` (registry/selector), `G.11` (refresh orchestration), `G.10` (shipping boundary), `F.9` (BridgeCard & CL), `G.7` (bridge calibration & Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane), `F.8` (Policy pins: `PolicySpecRef`/`MintDecisionRef` resolvability), `A.10` (anchors), `E.10` (LEX twin registers), `E.5.2` (notational independence), `E.18/A.21/A.27` (GateCrossing visibility).

**Non‑duplication note (Phase‑2 universalization).** This pattern introduces **kit‑owned packaging surfaces** for SoS‑LOG bundles and maturity ladders. All **Part‑G‑wide invariants** (no shadow specs, Bridge‑only crossings + visibility, tri‑state guard domain, penalties→`R_eff`‑only, set‑return semantics, P2W split, typed RSCR triggers + alias docking, single‑owner defaults, shipping boundary) are **routed via `G.Core`** and are not restated here.

**Modularity note (policy‑id pins are reference‑only).** This kit may pin/cite policy ids (e.g., `Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane` policies, `FailureBehaviorPolicyId`, illumination‑promotion policy ids, and E/E‑LOG policy ids) **as references only**. Conformance relies on the policy‑pin resolvability discipline of `F.8:8.1` (i.e., policy ids are not “inlined”; and when newly minted, they are backed by resolvable `PolicySpecRef` + `MintDecisionRef`). `G.8` does not define policy semantics and MUST NOT silently mint policy ids.

Method families compete within a `CG‑Frame`, but dispatch is only lawful if (i) admissibility decisions remain **tri‑state** and auditable, (ii) evidence and crossings are **explicitly citable** (by ids, not prose), and (iii) selection preserves **set/portfolio semantics** under partial orders. In practice, SoS‑LOG rules (`C.23`) and “maturity stories” are often distributed across prose, dashboards, and ad‑hoc checklists, with thresholds embedded where they do not belong and with missing pins for evidence paths, crossings, and editions.

## Content

## Problem frame

Method families compete within a `CG‑Frame`, but dispatch is only lawful if (i) admissibility decisions remain **tri‑state** and auditable, (ii) evidence and crossings are **explicitly citable** (by ids, not prose), and (iii) selection preserves **set/portfolio semantics** under partial orders. In practice, SoS‑LOG rules (`C.23`) and “maturity stories” are often distributed across prose, dashboards, and ad‑hoc checklists, with thresholds embedded where they do not belong and with missing pins for evidence paths, crossings, and editions.

This pattern provides the missing packaging kit: a **selector‑facing, UTS‑citable bundle** that binds **(a)** rule ids (semantics owned by `C.23`), **(b)** an ordinal/poset maturity ladder (published as a citable card), and **(c)** explicit wiring to Acceptance (`G.4`), EvidenceGraph (`G.6`), selection/registry (`G.5`), and refresh (`G.11`)—without creating any shadow contract surfaces.
## Problem

1. **Selector needs a stable input artefact.** `G.5` cannot consume “maturity narratives” and scattered SoS‑LOG snippets without re‑authoring semantics or inventing implicit defaults.
2. **Thresholds leak into LOG.** Numeric gates are often embedded directly into rule text or ladder rungs, blurring the boundary between LOG decisions (`C.23`) and Acceptance thresholds (`G.4`).
3. **Auditability is brittle.** Decisions (`pass/degrade/abstain`) lack stable, citable links to evidence paths (`G.6`) and crossing pins (Bridge/CL/Φ policy ids), so later re‑checks and RSCR become ad‑hoc.
4. **Telemetry contaminates decision semantics.** QD/OEE/illumination signals are frequently treated as dominance inputs without explicit policy pins; edition drift then silently changes outcomes.
5. **Refresh is under‑specified.** Bundle evolution (rules, ladders, pins, policies, editions) must be RSCR‑addressable via typed trigger kinds, not by free‑text “reasons”.
## Forces

| Force                                        | Tension                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pluralism vs. dispatchability**            | Preserve multiple method families and partial orders ↔ still provide a consumable artefact for `G.5`.        |
| **Auditability vs. authoring friction**      | Fine‑grained pins and citations ↔ keeping authoring lightweight and notation‑independent.                    |
| **Maturity as poset vs. scalar ranking**     | Maturity is inherently non‑scalar ↔ teams want a “single readiness number”.                                  |
| **Telemetry richness vs. decision hygiene**  | Rich QD/OEE telemetry ↔ avoid illegitimate promotion into dominance without explicit policy.                 |
| **Design‑time packaging vs. run‑time trace** | Authoring produces stable bundles ↔ run‑time produces branch‑specific path traces and admissibility ledgers. |
| **Interoperability vs. crossing discipline** | Reuse across contexts/planes ↔ prevent implicit crossings (Bridge‑only + visible).                           |
## Solution — Publish SoS‑LOG bundles and maturity cards as UTS‑citable kit

### G.Core linkage (normative)

**Builds on:** `G.Core` (Part‑G core invariants; routing/delegation hub)

**GCoreLinkageManifest (normative; size‑controlled).**
*(Canonical shape, Nil‑elision, and Expansion rule are per `G.Core:4.2`.)*

**Separation rule (Phase‑2).** Method‑/generator‑specific pins are **normatively specified** only inside `Extensions` as `GPatternExtension` modules (see `G.8:5.*`). The bundle/ledger schema may mention such fields only as **extension‑gated optionals**, with the authoritative pin/edition/policy requirements stated in the corresponding extension block. The core linkage manifest lists only base‑kit pins and Part‑G‑wide linkage.

`GCoreLinkageManifest := ⟨
CoreConformanceProfileIds := {
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.AuthoringBase,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.TriStateGuard,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.UTSWhenPublicIdsMinted,
GCoreConformanceProfileId.PartG.ShippingBoundary
},

RSCRTriggerSetIds := { GCoreTriggerSetId.EvidenceGraphKit },

CorePinSetIds := {
GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal,
},

CorePinsRequired := {
  // Pattern-owned public ids (strengthen conditional pins where G.8 publishes UTS artefacts)
  UTSRowId[],                    // bundle/ledger/card rows + any referenced UTS rows
  SoS‑LOGBundleRef,
  SoSLogRuleId[],
  MethodFamilyId,
  HomeContext,

  // Closed value sets (ids only; UTS-registered)
  DegradeModeEnum,
  MaturityRungs,

  // Maturity ladder pins
  MaturityCardRef,               // required; recommended: published as separate UTS artefact
  MaturityRungId?,               // iff a specific rung is asserted at packaging/run-time

  // Evidence / provenance pins
  A10EvidenceGraphRef?[],        // packaging-time A.10 carriers (when PathId/PathSliceId not yet available)
  EvidenceGraphId?,              // iff resolvable to G.6 EvidenceGraph
  PathId[]/PathSliceId[]?,       // run-time ledgers typically have them

  // Authoring traceability (SoTA-of-description)
  AuthoringMethodDescriptionRefs?[],  // edition-pinned method-description refs
},

DefaultsConsumed := {
DefaultId.PortfolioMode,
DefaultId.DominanceRegime,
DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff
},
⟩`

*(RSCR payload pins typically include: `SoS‑LOGBundleRef`, `SoSLogRuleId[]`, `MaturityRungId?`, and `EvidenceGraphId/PathId/PathSliceId?`.  
Crossing payload pins (Bridge/CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane) are introduced **only when reuse is asserted**, via `G.8:Ext.BridgeReuseWiring`.  
Method-/generator‑specific payload pins are listed only inside the relevant `GPatternExtension` blocks in `G.8:5`.)*

*(Conditionality note for defaults.)* Include `DefaultId.GammaFoldForR_eff` in `DefaultsConsumed` **only if** the bundle/ledger exports aggregated `R_eff` summaries (otherwise Nil‑elide it).
### Kit: objects and naming discipline (LEX heads; twin‑register safe)

**Objects / surfaces (pattern‑owned).**

* **`SoS‑LOG.Rule`**
  A rule id that denotes an executable tri‑state decision schema `{pass | degrade(mode) | abstain}` for `(TaskSignature, MethodFamily)`. *(“pass” may be described as “admit” in prose, but the normative tri‑state vocabulary is `G.Core`’s `{pass|degrade|abstain}`.)*
  **Semantics are owned by `C.23`.** `G.8` only packages rule ids and binding pins.

* **`SoS‑LOGBundle@Context`**
  A selector‑facing, notation‑independent packaging object published to UTS.

* **`AdmissibilityLedger@Context`**
  A run‑time ledger view that records admissibility outcomes, cited evidence paths, branch tokens, and the pins required for audit/refresh.

* **`MethodFamily.MaturityCardDescription@Context`**
  A maturity ladder description published as a citable artefact: **ordinal/poset**, closed rungs, `ReferencePlane` declared; no thresholds inside.

**Naming discipline (E.10 + “Spaces ≠ Maps”).**

* Technical heads are normative; Plain twins are didactic only and MUST NOT cross kinds.
* Do **not** alias `CharacteristicSpace` and `DescriptorMap`.

  * `DescriptorMapRef` is a **map‑reference** (typically used with QD archives).
  * `CharacteristicSpaceRef` is a **space‑reference** (grid/cell semantics, if used).
* Editions are pinned on `…Ref.edition` fields (not on informal names).
### SoS‑LOGBundle@Context schema (conceptual; notation‑independent)

A conforming bundle is a UTS‑published object whose internal representation is free, but whose **field meanings** are stable:

```
SoS-LOGBundle@Context :=
⟨
  UTS.id := SoS‑LOGBundleRef,
  Edition,

  // Scope + contract pins (from GCorePinSetId.PartG.AuthoringMinimal)
  CG-FrameContext,
  describedEntity := ⟨GroundingHolon, ReferencePlane⟩,
  CNSpecRef.edition,
  CGSpecRef.edition,

  MethodFamilyId,
  HomeContext,

  SoSLogRuleId[] ,               // ids only; semantics owned by C.23
  ClosedEnums: {DegradeModeEnum, MaturityRungs},  // ids only; UTS-registered closed value sets
  A10EvidenceGraphRef?[] ,        // packaging-time evidence carriers (A.10 anchors) when paths are not yet stable
  MaturityCardRef ,               // UTS ref to maturity card (required; may be embedded but MUST be citable)
  MaturityRungId? ,               // if a specific rung is asserted at packaging time

  // Optional: Acceptance wiring (thresholds remain owned by G.4)
  AcceptanceClauseId[]? ,

  // Optional: Evidence wiring (for later audit & rung transition justification)
  EvidenceGraphId? ,
  PathId[]/PathSliceId[]? ,

  // Optional: cross-context/plane wiring (only when reuse is asserted)
  BridgeId/BridgeCardId? ,
  CL/CL^k/CL^plane? ,
  Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane policy-ids? ,

  // Optional: selector semantics pins (explicit value or resolved via DefaultOwnershipIndex)
  PortfolioMode? ,
  DominanceRegime? ,

  // Optional: QD / OEE pins (only when those surfaces are declared)
  CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition? ,
  DescriptorMapRef.edition? ,
  DistanceDefRef.edition? ,
  EmitterPolicyRef? ,
  InsertionPolicyRef? ,
  // Optional: Open-ended pins (only when those surfaces are declared)
  GeneratorFamilyId? ,
  EnvironmentValidityRegionId? ,
  CouplerPolicyId? ,
  TransferRulesRef.edition? ,

  // Optional: branch/failure wiring (policy-bound)
  FailureBehaviorPolicyId? ,
  SoSLogBranchId[]? ,

  // Optional: authoring traceability (SoTA-of-description)
  AuthoringMethodDescriptionRefs?[] ,

  Notes

```

**Bundle discipline (normative intent; semantics routed):**

* `SoS‑LOGBundle@Context` **does not introduce** new legality or normalization rules; it cites the pinned references above.
* Thresholds and numeric gates are cited by id from `G.4` Acceptance (no embedding inside the bundle).
* If cross‑context/plane reuse is asserted, crossing pins are made explicit (Bridge/CL/Φ policy ids), and evidence paths are citable when available.

**Binding obligations B1–B5 (packaging‑only; wiring‑only; semantics routed):**

* **B1 — Evidence wiring.** At packaging time the bundle SHOULD provide resolvable evidence refs (typically `A10EvidenceGraphRef?[]` and/or `EvidenceGraphId?`). At run time, admissibility outcomes SHOULD cite `PathId/PathSliceId` when available (`G.6`), so rung transitions and `degrade/abstain` traces are audit‑stable.
* **B2 — CL/plane routing pins.** When reuse across Context/plane is asserted, the bundle/ledger MUST pin the relevant Bridge/CL/Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane policy ids (reference‑only; resolvable per `F.8:8.1`) and MUST respect the core penalty routing (penalties affect `R_eff` only; `F/G` invariance via `G.Core`).
* **B3 — Portfolio/QD fields.** If the bundle/ledger exposes QD/portfolio fields (e.g., `PortfolioMode=Archive`), it MUST pin the descriptor/distance/insertion/emitter artefacts (editions/policies as applicable). Illumination remains **report‑only** unless explicitly promoted by a `G.4` owner policy id that is pinned and recorded in the run‑time trace.
* **B4 — Open‑ended fields.** If the bundle binds an open‑ended generator family, it MUST pin `GeneratorFamilyId` and `TransferRulesRef.edition` (and any validity region/coupler policy ids when used). Unknown transfer validity MUST route to `degrade`/branching, not to an ad‑hoc fourth status.
* **B5 — Telemetry hooks.** On any material telemetry event (illumination increase, archive insertion, probe accounting update, open‑ended coverage/regret proxy update), the emitted telemetry pins SHOULD include the controlling policy ids plus the relevant edition pins (e.g., `DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`) and, when available, `PathSliceId` to keep RSCR planning auditable.
### AdmissibilityLedger@Context (run‑time view; selector‑facing)

A conforming ledger is a UTS‑published view (or a view‑projection of a Work/Audit artefact) with rows of the form:

`⟨ MethodFamilyId, SoSLogRuleId, GuardDecision ∈ {pass|degrade|abstain}, DegradeMode?/SoSLogBranchId[]?, MaturityRungId?, AcceptanceClauseId[]?, EvidencePathRefs?, CrossingPins?, PortfolioMode?, DominanceRegime?, Edition ⟩`

Where `EvidencePathRefs` are typically `PathId[]/PathSliceId[]` when `G.6` is in use (or resolvable), and “CrossingPins” are the explicit Bridge/CL/Φ policy pins when reuse is asserted.
### Maturity ladder as a citable poset (published card)

`MethodFamily.MaturityCardDescription@Context` is published with:

* closed rungs (UTS‑registered identifiers),
* `Scale kind = ordinal` and a declared `ReferencePlane`,
* (optional) explicit poset edges / precedence constraints,
* rung transition justifications that cite evidence paths (typically `G.6` paths).

This card is a **description** suitable for dispatch/audit and refresh; it is not a competing contract surface.
### Interfaces (minimal I/O standard; conceptual)

| Interface                               | Consumes                                                                                   | Produces                                                                              |

| **G.8‑3 `Publish_MaturityCard`**        | Ladder description + (optional) evidence path refs for rung transitions                    | `MaturityCardDescription@Context` (UTS row; editioned)                                |
| **G.8‑4 `Expose_TelemetryHooks`**       | QD/OEE/archive/open‑ended telemetry signals (when declared)                                | telemetry pins for refresh (`…Ref.edition`, policy‑ids, `PathSliceId` when available) |
## Extensions (pattern‑scoped; non‑core)

`G.8` keeps method/generator specificity out of the core kit. Any such specificity appears as `GPatternExtension` blocks with stable **PatternScopeId**s.

**RSCRTriggerKindIds:** `{RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta, RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange, RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange}`
**Notes (wiring‑only):**

**Notes (wiring‑only):**
* Open‑ended coverage/regret (or similar) remains telemetry unless explicitly promoted by an owner policy.
## Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

**Show‑A — Tri‑state admissibility with set‑valued selection (multi‑criteria).**
A CG‑Frame hosts multiple offline/robust decision families (e.g., conservative offline RL and transformer‑based policy models post‑2020). The bundle publishes `RuleId[]` (SoS‑LOG semantics in `C.23`), cites `AcceptanceClauseId[]` for any floors (owned by `G.4`), and emits an `AdmissibilityLedger` whose rows cite `PathSliceId` (when available) for each `pass/degrade/abstain`. `G.5` consumes the ledger and returns a **portfolio set** under the declared partial order—no scalar “winner”.

**Show‑B — QD archive dispatch with edition‑pinned descriptors (post‑2015 QD families).**
A method family uses a modern QD line (e.g., CMA‑ES‑driven archives, differentiable QD variants, and large‑scale JAX‑style QD toolchains). The bundle pins `DescriptorMapRef.edition` and `DistanceDefRef.edition`, plus insertion/emitter policies. Illumination metrics are logged as telemetry; any promotion into dominance is only via explicit CAL policy pins (recorded in the admissibility trace).

**Show‑C — Open‑ended environment–method co‑evolution (post‑2018 open‑ended families).**
A generator family operates in an open‑ended setting (e.g., POET‑style and PAIRED‑style regimes). The bundle carries `TransferRulesRef.edition` and validity region pins; unknown transfer validity triggers a `degrade` branch rather than an ad‑hoc fourth status. Telemetry (coverage/regret proxies) is emitted for refresh planning, not silently turned into dominance.
## Bias‑Annotation

Lenses tested: **Gov**, **Arch**, **Onto/Epist**, **Prag**, **Did**.
Scope: packaging kit only. Rule semantics remain owned by `C.23`; thresholds remain owned by `G.4`; evidence path semantics remain owned by `G.6`; selection semantics remain owned by `G.5`.
## Conformance Checklist (CC‑G8)

* **CC‑G8‑CoreRef (G.Core conformance bridge).**
  A conforming `G.8` SHALL satisfy the **effective** set of `CC‑GCORE‑*` obligations implied by `G.8:4.1` (expanded per `G.Core:4.2`), including required pins, trigger sets, and default‑ownership routing.

* **CC‑G8‑1 (No thresholds in LOG).**
  Any numeric gate, maturity floor, or threshold SHALL be authored as a `G.4` Acceptance artefact and cited by id; the LOG bundle/ladder SHALL NOT embed thresholds.

* **CC‑G8‑2 (Tri‑state discipline; delegated).**
  Guard outcomes SHALL obey the tri‑state domain and unknown handling defined in `G.Core` (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑GUARD‑1`).  
  Any sandbox/probe‑only behaviour SHALL be represented as an explicit `C.23` branch and MUST pin (and record) the controlling policy id (typically an E/E‑LOG policy id via `C.19`), rather than inventing a fourth status or silently coercing unknowns.

* **CC‑G8‑3 (Path citation when evidence is path‑addressable).**
  When `G.6` is in use (or resolvable), every recorded `pass/degrade/abstain` outcome in the `AdmissibilityLedger` MUST cite `PathId/PathSliceId` (run‑time). At packaging time, the bundle/ledger SHALL at minimum provide resolvable evidence refs (e.g., `EvidenceGraphId?` + anchor refs).

* **CC‑G8‑4 (Crossing visibility and penalty routing; delegated).**
  Any cross‑Context/plane reuse asserted by the bundle/ledger SHALL satisfy the core crossing visibility and penalty routing invariants (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑CROSS‑1` and `CC‑GCORE‑PEN‑1`).

* **CC‑G8‑5 (Portfolio/dominance hygiene; delegated).**
  The bundle/ledger SHALL treat portfolio/dominance fields as pinned inputs and SHALL route any omitted defaults via the single‑owner Default Ownership Index (delegation to `CC‑GCORE‑DEF‑1` and `CC‑GCORE‑SET‑1`; owners include `CC‑G5.23` for `DefaultId.PortfolioMode` and `CC‑G5.28` for `DefaultId.DominanceRegime`). It MUST NOT restate default values locally.  
  If the bundle/ledger records telemetry that could influence dispatch (e.g., illumination/QD/OEE/open‑ended proxies), such telemetry SHALL remain report‑only unless explicitly promoted by a `G.4` owner policy id that is pinned and recorded in the run‑time trace.

* **CC‑G8‑6 (QD/OEE edition discipline).**
  When QD/OEE surfaces are declared, the bundle/ledger MUST pin the relevant editions and policies (`DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, insertion/emitter policies, and `TransferRulesRef.edition` when applicable).  
  `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` is **required iff** cell boundaries / de‑dup rules / parity depend on the space definition, and MUST NOT be used as a substitute for `DescriptorMapRef.edition`.

* **CC‑G8‑7 (Maturity is ordinal/poset).**
  Maturity ladders SHALL be authored as ordinal/poset descriptions with **closed** rung ids (`MaturityRungs`, UTS‑registered) and a declared `ReferencePlane`, and SHALL be published as a citable UTS artefact (editioned; twin‑register safe).  
  Rung transitions, when asserted, MUST be justifiable by citable evidence paths (when available).

* **CC‑G8‑8 (Spaces ≠ Maps).**
  `CharacteristicSpace` and `DescriptorMap` SHALL remain strictly distinct kinds; naming and twin‑register discipline must be respected.

* **CC‑G8‑9 (Notational independence).**
  The bundle, ledger, and maturity card SHALL remain notation‑independent (per `E.5.2`); any serialization choice is non‑normative and belongs outside Part‑G core.

* **CC‑G8‑10 (MOO cross‑reference).**
  When a LOG bundle is used to drive or justify a produced portfolio outcome, the producing Work/Audit artefact SHOULD cite the controlling mechanism ids (e.g., parity/shipping/refresh artefact ids) and relevant policy pins; no “black box” provenance.

* **CC‑G8‑11 (SoTA‑of‑description trace).**
  If authoring methods (e.g., discovery, clustering, summarisation) materially shaped rule text or rung definitions, the bundle/card SHOULD cite their method description refs (edition‑pinned) to support cross‑stance traceability.
## Common Anti‑Patterns and How to Avoid Them

* **Anti‑pattern:** Embedding thresholds inside SoS‑LOG rules or ladder rungs.
  **Avoid:** thresholds live in `G.4` Acceptance; bundle only cites clause ids.

* **Anti‑pattern:** Treating illumination/QD telemetry as a hidden scalar score that changes dominance.
  **Avoid:** keep telemetry report‑only unless explicitly promoted by an owner policy pin.

* **Anti‑pattern:** Publishing a bundle that “implies” cross‑context reuse without Bridge/CL/Φ pins.
  **Avoid:** if reuse is asserted, publish the crossing pins; otherwise downstream must abstain from reuse.

* **Anti‑pattern:** Re‑defining `PortfolioMode`/`DominanceRegime` defaults in the bundle text.
  **Avoid:** cite the single owners via `G.Core.DefaultOwnershipIndex`.

* **Anti‑pattern:** Recording RSCR “reasons” as prose labels only.
  **Avoid:** emit canonical `RSCRTriggerKindId` values per `G.Core`.
## Consequences

* **Positive:** `G.5` receives a stable, citable, selector‑facing artefact without importing rule semantics or threshold logic.
* **Positive:** Audit and refresh become tractable: pins, crossings, evidence paths, and trigger kinds are explicit.
* **Positive:** Maturity remains non‑scalar, reducing illegitimate aggregation and “readiness theater”.
* **Negative:** Requires stricter authoring discipline (UTS publication, pin completeness, explicit wiring).
* **Negative:** If evidence paths are not maintained (`G.6` absent), auditability degrades and downstream must rely on weaker refs or abstain.
## Rationale

`C.23` owns **rule semantics**, `G.4` owns **thresholding/acceptance**, `G.6` owns **path‑addressable provenance**, and `G.5` owns **selection/registry semantics**. Without a dedicated packaging kit, projects either (i) duplicate semantics inside ad‑hoc “decision bundles” (creating shadow specs), or (ii) leave dispatch un‑auditable. `G.8` keeps these boundaries strict while providing a single, consumable surface.
## SoTA‑Echoing (informative; post‑2015 practice alignment)

This pattern’s separation of **decision rules**, **acceptance thresholds**, **provenance paths**, and **set‑valued outputs** echoes post‑2015 practice in:

* **Set‑valued / portfolio‑first selection** (multi‑objective and uncertainty‑aware regimes; avoiding forced scalar winners).
* **Quality‑Diversity and archive‑based evaluation** (post‑2015 QD variants emphasize edition‑pinned descriptors/distances and telemetry‑driven refresh).
* **Open‑endedness / curriculum generation** (post‑2018 lines emphasize explicit transfer rules, safe degrade branches, and telemetry‑driven orchestration rather than hidden gates).
* **Reproducibility‑aware publishing** (explicit identifiers, pinned editions/policies, citable traces rather than prose‑only decision rationales).

*(Examples are illustrative; they do not introduce new Part‑G‑wide norms.)*
## Relations

**Builds on:** `G.Core`, `C.23`, `G.4`, `G.6`, `G.5`, `C.22`
**Uses:** `A.10` (anchors), `F.8` (policy-id resolvability), `F.9` + `G.7` (when cross‑Context/plane reuse is asserted), `G.11` (refresh planning/trigger consumption), `G.10` (shipping boundary; if bundled artefacts are shipped), `E.10` (LEX twin registers), `E.5.2` (notation independence), `E.18/A.21/A.27` (GateCrossing visibility); optional `C.18` (QD) / `C.19` (E/E‑LOG) when those surfaces are declared.
**Publishes to:** `UTS` (bundle/ledger/card), `G.5` (selector/registry consumption), `G.11` (refresh via typed triggers and pinned telemetry)
**Constrains:** any SoS‑LOG packaging that claims FPF conformance for selector‑facing dispatch across method families.
## Author’s quick checklist (informative)

* [ ] `RuleId[]` are ids only; rule semantics are owned by `C.23` (no re-definition in this bundle).
* [ ] `SoSLogRuleId[]` are ids only; rule semantics are owned by `C.23` (no re-definition in this bundle).
* [ ] Any numeric gates/thresholds are `G.4` Acceptance artefacts cited by id (no thresholds embedded in LOG or rungs).
* [ ] Evidence is citable: at run time use `PathId/PathSliceId` when available; at packaging time provide resolvable `A10EvidenceGraphRef?[]` / `EvidenceGraphId?`.
* [ ] Any cross‑Context/plane reuse is explicit: `BridgeId/BridgeCardId`, `CL/CL^k/CL^plane`, and `Φ/Ψ/Φ_plane` policy ids are pinned (policy ids resolvable per `F.8:8.1`).
* [ ] Portfolio/dominance defaults are not restated: route via `G.Core.DefaultOwnershipIndex` (owners live outside `G.8`, typically `G.5`).
* [ ] QD pins are edition/policy pinned (`DescriptorMapRef.edition`, `DistanceDefRef.edition`, insertion/emitter policies); `CharacteristicSpaceRef.edition` is pinned iff cell boundaries/de‑dup/parity depend on it; **Spaces ≠ Maps**.
* [ ] If open‑ended surfaces are declared, pin `GeneratorFamilyId`, `TransferRulesRef.edition`, and any validity/coupler policy ids; unknown transfer validity routes to `degrade`/branching (no “fourth status”).
* [ ] `MaturityRungs` is a closed, UTS‑registered set; the maturity ladder is ordinal/poset with a declared `ReferencePlane`; rung transitions cite evidence.
* [ ] RSCR triggers are emitted as canonical `RSCRTriggerKindId` values (no prose-only “reasons”).
* [ ] Notation independence (`E.5.2`) and twin‑register discipline (`E.10`) are respected for all published heads/ids.
* [ ] If authoring tools materially shaped rule/rung content, cite `AuthoringMethodDescriptionRefs?[]` (edition‑pinned) for cross‑stance traceability.
