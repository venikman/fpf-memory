# FPF Artefact Architecture
> Pattern `E.4` · Stable
> Part E - The FPF Constitution and Authoring Guides

The FPF ecosystem produces a wide range of artifacts, from timeless, normative principles to rapidly evolving pedagogical materials and executable tools. If these different types of artifacts are mingled without a clear architectural separation, the ecosystem becomes difficult to navigate, govern, and maintain. Users cannot easily distinguish binding rules from helpful advice, and the entire framework's release cycle becomes coupled to its most volatile component.

## Content

## Problem frame

The FPF ecosystem produces a wide range of artifacts, from timeless, normative principles to rapidly evolving pedagogical materials and executable tools. If these different types of artifacts are mingled without a clear architectural separation, the ecosystem becomes difficult to navigate, govern, and maintain. Users cannot easily distinguish binding rules from helpful advice, and the entire framework's release cycle becomes coupled to its most volatile component.
## Problem

How can we structure the FPF ecosystem to ensure a clean separation of concerns between normative concepts, didactic materials, and executable tooling? A formal architecture is required to maintain conceptual purity, enable independent evolution of components, and provide a clear map for all stakeholders.
## Forces

| Force | Tension |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stability vs. Agility** | The conceptual core must evolve slowly and deliberately ↔ tools and tutorials must iterate quickly to keep pace with technology and user needs. |
| **Authority vs. Accessibility** | Users need to know which rules are normative and binding ↔ they also need accessible, non-normative guides to help them learn. |
| **Modularity vs. Cohesion** | The different artifact families must be able to evolve independently ↔ they must remain part of a single, coherent FPF ecosystem. |
## Solution

The FPF ecosystem is formally stratified into three canonical **artefact families**. Each family has a distinct purpose and is governed by different rules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. The interaction between these families is governed by the **Unidirectional Dependency Principle** (see Guard-Rail E.5.3).

1.  **The Conceptual Core (The Canon):** This family contains the **normative** pattern language of FPF. It is the single source of truth for all universal concepts, rules, and invariants. It is defined to be tool-agnostic and notation-independent. This family represents the timeless "law" of FPF.

2.  **The Tooling Reference:** This family contains **executable artifacts** that implement or verify the normative rules of the Core. This includes reference linters, simulators, and data schemas. This family is the "instrument" that makes the law of the Core operational.

3.  **The Pedagogical Companion:** This family contains **non-normative, didactic materials** designed to help humans learn and apply FPF. This includes tutorials, worked examples, and playbooks. This family is the "textbook" that explains both the law and the instruments.
## Archetypal Grounding (System / Episteme)

*   **For a `U.System`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines the universal pattern `U.System`.
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides a modeling language profile or a serialization schema for modeling systems.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a tutorial on how to model a water pump using that profile.

*   **For an `U.Episteme`:**
    *   **Conceptual Core:** Defines `U.Episteme` and the F-G-R assurance tuple components (`F/R` characteristics plus `G` as ClaimScope).
    *   **Tooling Reference:** Provides the reference linting tool to automatically score epistemes.
    *   **Pedagogical Companion:** Provides a case study on how a scientific theory's R-score evolves over time.
## Conformance Checklist

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CC-E.4.1** | Every artifact in the FPF ecosystem **MUST** declare which of the three families (Core, Tooling, Pedagogy) it belongs to. |
| **CC-E.4.2** | The content of each artifact **MUST** be consistent with the defined purpose of its family (e.g., no normative rules in the Pedagogical Companion). |
| **CC‑E.4.3** | Artefacts in the Tooling or Pedagogy families SHALL NOT be imported by artefacts in the Conceptual Core. |
## Consequences

| Benefits | Trade-offs / Mitigations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Users and contributors can immediately identify the nature and authority of any given artifact. | **Requires Discipline:** Authors must be careful to place new content in the correct artifact family. |
| **Decoupled Release Cycles:** The Core can maintain a stable, slow release cadence, while the Tooling and Pedagogy artifact family can evolve rapidly. | - |
| **Architectural Clarity:** Provides a simple, powerful mental model for navigating the entire FPF ecosystem. | - |
## Rationale

This pattern establishes the macro-architecture of the entire FPF ecosystem. By separating the timeless "why" and "what" (the Conceptual Core) from the practical "how" (Tooling) and the educational "how-to-learn" (Pedagogy), it creates a system that is simultaneously stable, agile, and accessible. This layered architecture is a proven pattern in large-scale systems, from the OSI model in networking to the structure of modern operating systems, and it is essential for FPF's long-term health and scalability.
## Relations

*   **Instantiates:** **P-5 (FPF Layering)** at a macro-level.
*   **Is Constrained by:** **E.5.3 (Unidirectional Dependency)**.
*   **Is Foundation For:** The entire authoring and governance model, as it defines the "territories" where different rules apply.

> *“A canon without a rationale is scripture; a rationale without a canon is gossip. FPF keeps both, fused in patterns.”*
