# G.Core:4.3.4.1 - Canonical kind definitions (normative, minimal)
> Preface node `heading:g-core-4-3-4-1-canonical-kind-definitions-normative-minimal:54477`

## Content

Each `RSCRTriggerKindId` SHALL have a short, stable definition in `G.Core` (single-writer) to prevent semantic drift.

| RSCRTriggerKindId | Minimal meaning (cause class) | Typical payload pins (non-exhaustive) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.LegalitySurfaceEdit` | A legality surface changed (CG‑Spec: ComparatorSet/SCP/Γ_fold/MinimalEvidence, or equivalent legality inputs). | `CGSpecRef.edition`, `ComparatorSetRef.edition`, `SCPRef.edition`, `ΓFoldRef.edition` |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.PenaltyPolicyEdit` | A penalty / Φ / Ψ / FailureBehavior / SoS‑LOG branch policy changed. | penalty policy ids, `Φ`/`Ψ` policy ids, SoS‑LOG branch id pins |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.CrossingBundleEdit` | A crossing bundle changed (Bridge/CL routing, crossing-bundle registry cards, crossing policy pins), including `edition_key` changes of crossing‑relevant artefacts (BridgeCards, CrossingBundle registries, UTS rows for crossing artefacts). | `BridgeId/BridgeCardId`, `BridgeMatrixId?`, `CL*` ids, crossing policy ids, `UTSRowId[]`, `PathId/PathSliceId?` |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.ReferencePlaneEdit` | ReferencePlane or plane-routing surface changed. | `ReferencePlaneId`, plane-policy ids |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange` | Any pinned edition relevant to downstream artifacts changed (including **`CNSpecRef.edition`**, `CGSpecRef.edition`, comparator/method/descriptor/distance/etc.). Crossing‑artefact edition_key changes are additionally classified as `CrossingBundleEdit` per multi‑cause discipline. | changed `*.edition` pins, affected `PathSliceId`s |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.TokenizationOrNameChange` | A published tokenization / naming / alias surface changed in a way that can affect docking, citations, or dispatch (e.g., UTS Name Cards, twin labels, alias maps). | affected `UTSRowId[]`, `NameCardId[]`, alias ids / maps |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.PolicyPinChange` | A policy-id pin used by characterization changed (selection, insertion, emission, routing, refresh policy, etc.). | policy ids (and other non-edition configuration pins when they are explicitly pinned) |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.TelemetryDelta` | Telemetry inputs that influence refresh/selection changed (not merely display-only). | telemetry ids/refs, `Audit`-published pins |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.FreshnessOrDecayEvent` | Time/freshness/decay conditions affecting validity changed (window shift, decay thresholds, freshness policy edits). | freshness window refs/ids, decay/freshness policy ids |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.EvidenceSurfaceEdit` | Evidence graph / evidence surface changed in ways that affect admissibility/acceptance/comparison. | evidence pins, `EvidenceGraph` refs, affected `PathId`s |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.MaturityRungChange` | Maturity rung/ladder state changed for relevant artifacts or paths. | maturity rung ids, affected scopes |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.BaselineBindingEdit` | Planned baseline bindings changed (planned slot fillings / binding refs), requiring a re-run along the P2W path. | `SlotFillingsPlanItem` refs, planned pins, variance pins |
| `RSCRTriggerKindId.DefaultOwnerChange` | The owner of a `DefaultId` (as recorded in `G.Core.DefaultOwnershipIndex`) changed, or a default row was added/deprecated. | affected `DefaultId.*`, old owner ref, new owner ref |
