## Content

These patterns are allowed (and common). The square becomes operational when these links are used systematically.

## (D → A) Duty-to-gate linkage

When governance requires someone to comply with a gate:

* `D-*`: “Role **MUST** satisfy/enforce `A-*`.”

This separates **what is admissible** (A) from **who is responsible** (D).
## (E → A) Evidence-for-gate linkage

When gate decisions must be observable:

* `E-*`: “On rejection/acceptance due to `A-*`, carrier `C` is produced/observable under conditions …”

This separates **gate semantics** (A) from **evidence semantics** (E).
## (D → E) Duty-to-evidence linkage

When governance requires evidence production/retention/exposure or commits to measured properties:

* `D-*`: “Role **MUST** retain/expose carrier class `C` used by `E-*` …”
* `D-*`: “Provider **SHALL** meet `E-*` under exclusions …”

This separates **obligation/commitment** (D) from **adjudication** (E).
## (A/E → L) Semantic grounding linkage

When a gate predicate or measurement relies on definitions/invariants:

* `A-*` / `E-*` references `L-*` that define terms/metrics.

This prevents “metric drift” and “definition drift” across views.
## (D → L) Governance-to-definition linkage

When an obligation/commitment relies on precise term or metric meanings:

* `D-*` references `L-*` that define the terms/metrics it uses.

This keeps governance text from accidentally redefining semantics in prose.
