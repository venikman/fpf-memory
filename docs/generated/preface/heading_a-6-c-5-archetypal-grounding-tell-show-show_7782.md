# A.6.C:5 — Archetypal Grounding (Tell–Show–Show)
> Preface node `heading:a-6-c-5-archetypal-grounding-tell-show-show:7782`

## Content

## A.6.C:5.1 — Tell

If you use contract-language for a boundary, do not treat “the interface/spec” as an agent. Instead:

1. Identify the **promise content** (promise content) being promised,
2. Identify the accountable **Commitment** holder(s) (roles/agents),
3. Identify the **Utterance** surfaces that publish the boundary (signature/mechanism + MVPK views),
4. Identify the **Work + Evidence** carriers that could adjudicate whether commitments were met,
5. Route each claim through **L/A/D/E** and reference across quadrants rather than paraphrasing.
## A.6.C:5.2 — Show (System archetypes)

**(A) Software API boundary**

*Draft wording (contract soup):*
“The Payments API guarantees idempotency. Clients must provide `Idempotency-Key`. We log all requests. Availability is 99.9%.”

**Unpack + route:**

* **Utterance:** signature/mechanism publication for `PaymentsAPI` (MVPK faces: TechCard, InteropCard).
* **L:** define idempotency and the uniqueness semantics of `Idempotency-Key`.
  (“Idempotent” is a semantic property, not a duty.)
* **A:** admissibility predicate: request is admissible iff `Idempotency-Key` is present and valid.
  (Gate belongs to mechanism.)
* **D:** client implementers are obligated to satisfy the gate; provider implementers are accountable for the idempotency behavior **as defined in L** when the gate holds; provider commits to the availability target (scoped by window/exclusions).
  (Name the committing role; do not say “the API commits”.)
* **E:** evidence expectations: audit/log carriers include request id, idempotency key, rejection reason; availability measurement uses defined window and signal definition.

**(B) Hardware interface boundary**

*Draft wording:*
“The connector guarantees safe operation. Devices must not exceed 20V. Negotiation must succeed before power is applied.”

**Unpack + route:**

* **Utterance:** published interface spec (pinout, electrical ranges, handshake procedure).
* **L:** electrical invariants / allowable ranges are definitions and invariants (truth-conditional).
* **A:** admissibility predicate: power delivery is admissible only after handshake state reaches an agreed mode.
* **D:** manufacturer/integrator obligations: implement handshake; enforce voltage constraints.
* **E:** evidence: test-report carriers; measurement traces; observable negotiation logs (if exposed), or lab measurements under a declared method.
## A.6.C:5.3 — Show (Episteme archetypes)

**(C) Multiparty protocol boundary (behavioural/session type motif)**

*Draft wording:*
“The protocol guarantees progress. Participants must follow the sequence.”

**Unpack + route:**

* **Utterance:** protocol description (could be a type/protocol spec plus explanatory views).
* **L:** safety/progress properties as laws over the protocol model (truth-conditional, within the theory).
* **A:** admissibility: when an interaction trace is considered valid/admissible (e.g., runtime checks; compilation checks; gating conditions for entering a session).
* **D:** obligations on implementers/operators: implement the protocol; do not send messages outside the allowed state machine; publish conformance artefacts if required.
* **E:** evidence: message trace carriers; conformance test run artefacts; audit trails for disputed interactions.

**(D) Socio-technical “SLA + audit trail” boundary**

*Draft wording:*
“Provider shall respond within 4 hours for Severity‑1 incidents. Only Severity‑1 is covered. Evidence is provided by ticket logs.”

**Unpack + route:**

* **Promise content (service promise clause):** responsiveness promise for a defined incident class and window.
* **Utterance:** SLA publication (and its views for different audiences).
* **A:** admissibility predicate for the promise: ticket qualifies iff severity classification meets stated conditions.
* **D:** provider commitment to meet the target; client duties (e.g., provide required info); auditor duties if applicable.
* **E:** evidence: ticket carriers, timestamps, classification records, and the measurement procedure binding “4 hours” to a time window and clock source.
