# A.6.P:5.1 — System archetype: “same system across environments”
> Preface node `heading:a-6-p-5-1-system-archetype-same-system-across-environments:10917`

## Content

**Tell.**
An operations note says: “Staging is the same service as Production.” Months later, incident metrics are aggregated “because it’s the same thing”, and evidence across environments is mixed, producing an incorrect causal story.

**Show.**
Treat “same” as a red-flag umbrella token. Rewrite into an explicit cross-Context relation kind,
typed to the facet the draft actually uses (service delivery system sameness for actuals/evidence aggregation; not about promise contents).

**Show (candidate‑set note; endpoint facet restoration).**

```
CandidateSetNote(triggerSpan="service" in "same service", role=endpointFacet(p₁)):
- candidates: {promiseContent, serviceAccessPoint, serviceProviderPrincipal, serviceDeliverySystem}
- selected:   serviceDeliverySystem
- why:        the claim is later used to justify mixing operational actuals/evidence (metrics + incident logs);
  local cues point to delivery artefacts (manifests/config/test runs), not clause carriers
- consequence: endpoints typecheck as `DeliverySystemRef` participants; clause/provider facets are explicitly out-of-scope

sameDeliverySystemUnder(
  leftDeliverySystemRef  = SystemRef(staging_delivery_system),
  rightDeliverySystemRef = SystemRef(prod_delivery_system),
  scope     = ClaimScope{SLO_family = X, signals = {latency, error_rate}},
  Γ_time    = interval[2025-12-01, 2026-01-31],
  viewpoint = OpsViewpoint,
  witnesses = {deploymentManifestPins, configPins, testRunPins}
)

aggregationAdmissibleIff(
  relationRef  = RelationRef(sameDeliverySystemUnder, SystemRef(staging_delivery_system), SystemRef(prod_delivery_system), ed=…),
  target       = deliveryWorkMetrics,                   // actuals
  Γ_time       = interval[2025-12-01, 2026-01-31],
  witnesses    = {metricCarrierPins, incidentLogPins}   // evidence carriers for the actuals
)
```

**Show.**
Now the relation is auditable: aggregation is admissible only if the relation kind’s admissibility
claims say it preserves the needed characteristics under the declared scope/time, and if witnesses exist.
Cross-Context reuse is explicit and cannot piggyback on label identity.
