## Content

## The basic shape of a typed claim (manager view)

A typed claim has two independent parts:

1. **describedEntity (Kind).** *Which things the statement talks about.*
   “For every item of kind **k** in the **target context** (the selected **TargetSlice**) …”.
   — The **definition** of kind **k** lives in **KindSignature(k)** (with its **F**, C.3.2).
   — **Which items count as “k”** is evaluated in the **TargetSlice** (C.3.2) by a deterministic membership check.

2. **Applicability (Scope, G).** *Where the statement holds.*
   `U.ClaimScope(Claim)` is the **collection of contexts** where the claim is valid (USM A.2.6). Guards test: “Scope **covers** the TargetSlice”.

**Discipline.** The guard first checks **typed compatibility** (in the same Context: “is‑a / subkind‑of”; across Contexts: a **KindBridge**, C.3.3), then **Scope coverage** (USM), then **R** freshness and any bridge congruence penalties. See **C.3.A Guard\_TypedClaim**.
## Composition of typed claims

**Rule C‑T‑1 (typed pre‑check).** To compose a **producer claim** with a **consumer claim**, where the producer quantifies over kind **k (source)** and the consumer expects kind **k (expected)**:

* **same Context:** require **“is‑a / subkind‑of”** to hold (the source kind is a subkind of the expected kind) (C.3.1).
* **Cross‑context:** require a **KindBridge** that maps the source kind to a **local kind that is a subkind of the expected kind** in the target Context (C.3.3). If neither holds, the composition is **unsafe**; introduce a subkind, add an adapter (or a RoleMask), or decline.

* **Role‑aware option (same Context):** if the consumer expects a **RoleMask** over the expected kind, you may satisfy the mask’s explicit constraints (C.3.4) instead of changing kinds, provided those constraints are observable at gate time.

**Rule C‑T‑2 (scope after type).** After typed compatibility is satisfied, compute Scope as in USM:

* **Serial path:** take the **intersection** of the contributors’ claim scopes.
* **Parallel independent lines:** use **SpanUnion** of the serial scopes (only if independence is justified).

**Rule C‑T‑3 (no type‑by‑scope).** A kind mismatch **MUST NOT** be “fixed” by widening **G**. Changes in describedEntity require **subkind introduction**, **signature edits**, or a **KindBridge**—not a scope change.

**Manager hint.** First confirm the **port shape** matches (kinds line up), then check the **operating area** (scope), and finally look at **confidence** (evidence freshness plus any bridge congruence penalties).
## F–G–R with typed claims (what changes, what doesn’t)

* **F (Formality).**
  – **Claim‑level F** follows C.2.3 (weakest‑link along the claim’s support paths).
  – **KindSignature F** is declared **on the kind** (C.3.2) and influences claims **only** if the claim essentially depends on those predicates (weakest‑link again).
  – **Raising F** can *reveal* hidden assumptions (which may trigger ΔG in the claim), but **does not change G** by itself.

* **G (Scope).**
  – Always **set‑valued over Context slices** (USM A.2.6).
  – Typed reasoning does not alter G’s algebra (∈/∩/SpanUnion/translate).
  – Never infer Scope from “how general the wording sounds.”

* **R (Reliability).**
  – Evidence freshness/decay (validation windows) remains separate from Scope coverage.
  – **Cross‑context penalties** split cleanly: a **scope‑bridge penalty** (USM) and a **kind‑bridge penalty** (C.3.3). Both **reduce R only**; neither changes **F** or **G**.

**Manager rule of thumb.**
Start with the reliability from your support; then **apply the scope‑bridge penalty**; then **apply the kind‑bridge penalty**. Each step can only reduce reliability.  
You never add or average **F/G**: you **compose scope** per USM rules and apply **weakest‑link** for F/R along support paths.
## ESG gating with typed claims

* **Gate on F**, if your Context requires rigor before use (e.g., `U.Formality(Claim) ≥ F4`).
* **Gate on Scope coverage** (USM) and an explicit **time selector** (Γ_time) policy.
* **Gate on R freshness** and **minimum congruence** for bridges (e.g., `CL ≥ 2`, `CL^k ≥ 2`).
* **Do not** gate on **AT** (C.3.5); it is an informative facet only.
* Use **C.3.A guard macros** to keep guards short and auditable.
## How typed reasoning plugs into the CAL chain (Lang‑CHR → Role‑CAL)

> **Intent.** Show a clear, end‑to‑end path a manager can follow to take a typed claim from words to safe reuse across Contexts—without any tool or data‑governance assumptions. Each stage says **what it supplies**, **what it needs**, and **what it hands off** to the next stage.

### Lang‑CHR — stable words first

**What it supplies.** A disciplined vocabulary and controlled phrasing so that terms like *Vehicle*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *AdultPatient* have **one meaning** in the Context.

**What it requires.** Authors use controlled narrative (C.2.3 **F3**) at minimum: single‑meaning terms, explicit “shall / if / then”, and no drifting synonyms.

**Hand‑off.** A small, curated lexicon entry for each candidate *Kind‑word*; these become **`U.Kind` names** in the next step.

> *Manager hint.* If two teams cannot agree on the noun, you are not ready to type the claim. Resolve the noun in Lang‑CHR before introducing a Kind.
### Kind‑CAL (this Part) — name the describedEntity

**What it supplies.**
• **`U.Kind`** objects for those nouns; a partial order **`⊑`** (subkind‑of).
• **KindSignature(k)** (intent), with declared **F**.
• **Extension(k, slice)** and **`MemberOf(e,k,slice)`** (extent).
• (Optional) **AT (K0…K3)** as an **informative facet**.

**What it requires.**
• Deterministic membership (no “latest” defaults) and a clear rule for where membership is defined in each context.
• No “Kind scope”: Scope remains with claims/capabilities (USM).

> *Manager hint.* Use the kind’s **AT tag** only as a planning signal (where to invest rigor and tests). AT never gates decisions and never widens scope.

**Hand‑off.** Typed quantifier sites for claims: “∀ x ∈ **Extension(k, slice)** …”, plus a visible **`⊑`** lattice for compatibility checks down the line. Typed claim sites written in Plain language: “for every item of kind **k** in the **target context** …”, plus a visible **subkind‑of** lattice for compatibility checks down the line.

> *Manager hint.* Decide early whether your Kind is K0 (instance‑ish) or K2 (formal class). It sets your **ΔF/ΔR** budget expectations.
### Structure‑CAL — give Kinds usable shape

**What it supplies.** Structural building blocks **on Kinds**:
• **combinations** (“and”),
• **alternatives** (“either/or”),
• **records** (named fields),
• **functions** (inputs to outputs),
plus relations like **has‑attribute** and **part‑kind**, and the minimal invariants those structures must respect.

**What it requires.**
• Do not hide Scope inside structure.
• Put structural rules into the **KindSignature** as checkable statements (ideally **F4+**).

**Hand‑off.** Typed *ports and shapes* of claims/specifications (“this policy expects `PassengerCar × ControllerConfig`”), making compatibility checks crisp before any Scope math.

> *Manager hint.* If two claims expect different shapes (for example, one needs “Vehicle with ABS”, the other just “Vehicle”), plan a **subkind** or an **adapter**. Do not “solve” it by rewording the claim.

**Note (informative).** If a Context declares structural constructors on kinds (e.g., product/sum/record/function), editors SHOULD document the corresponding **Extension** inclusion laws for those constructors. Keep Scope in USM; do not hide it in structure.
### Compose‑CAL — compose with typed pre‑checks

**What it supplies.** The **order of checks** you must follow for safe composition:

1. **Typed compatibility**: in the same Context, the producer’s kind **is a subkind of** the consumer’s kind; across Contexts, a **KindBridge** maps the producer’s kind to a local kind that fits, with an acceptable **kind‑bridge congruence level** (C.3.3).
2. **Scope checks** (USM): along dependency paths, take the **intersection** of scopes; use **SpanUnion** only when support lines are truly independent.
3. **Assurance wiring**: apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**; check evidence freshness separately.

**What it requires.** Independence justification for **SpanUnion**; no “type‑by‑scope” fixes.

**Hand‑off.** A typed, scope‑checked composition that survives audit because each risk is accounted for in **R**.

> *Manager hint.* Run the **typed pre‑check** first. It is the cheapest failure to catch and prevents “scope gymnastics” that mask a type mismatch.
### CT2R‑LOG — speak the logic, keep the math honest

**What it supplies.**
• A clear logical reading of your typed claim: “for every item of kind **K**, condition **φ** holds” (or “there exists an item …”).
• Rules for refinement and substitution that respect the **subkind‑of** relation.
• When appropriate (K3), reasoning that treats structures as **equivalent up to isomorphism** (useful where exact identity is the wrong notion).

**What it requires.**
• Pick a logic that matches the **Formality** you declare (e.g., machine‑checked logic for higher **F**).
• When the logic travels across Contexts, use a **KindBridge** to keep meaning aligned; any mismatch is reflected as a **kind‑bridge penalty** in **R**.

**Hand‑off.** Proof obligations or reasoning templates that are consistent with your Kind/Structure setup and do not alter **G**.  **Shall‑note CT2R‑1.** Transferring typed formulas that depend on `MemberOf` across Contexts **uses a KindBridge**; any mismatch is accounted as **Ψ(`CL^k`)** in **R**. **F** and **G** remain unchanged. For **up‑to‑iso** situations, see **C.3.5 (AT)** for when K3 is appropriate.

> *Manager hint.* If your proof keeps failing when you move between Contexts, add a **bridge at the Kind level**; do not try to “fix” it by changing scope.
### Role‑CAL — adapt without cloning

**What it supplies.** **RoleMask(kind, Context)**: a named, registered adaptation (extra constraints or local aliases, with optional narrowing) that reuses the **same** kind instead of creating a new one.

**What it requires.**
• Constraints must be testable at gate time and give deterministic answers.
• If a constraint mask is reused often, **promote it to a subkind**.

**Hand‑off.** Context‑specific views that keep identity intact and make typed guards practical (“use `PaymentAccount@PCI` mask in these steps”).

> *Manager hint.* If the same mask appears in several guards, **promote** it to a subkind. This reduces future bridge and audit effort.
### Mini end‑to‑end example (manager‑oriented)

> **Scenario.** A risk gate for API requests must be reused by another program across Contexts.

**Lang‑CHR.** Settle on *Request*, *AuthenticatedRequest*, *RiskScore*, *BudgetSlack*; write them in controlled phrases (F3).

**Kind‑CAL.**
• Define `Kind Request` (K2) and a **subkind** `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ Request`;  publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **kind‑bridge congruence level 2** (loss note: token class is collapsed).
• Membership `MemberOf(e, AuthenticatedRequest, slice)` is deterministic under API v2.3 and Γ\_time policy.

**Structure‑CAL.**
• `AuthenticatedRequest` is a **record kind** with fields (headers, tokenProof, body); invariants relate tokenProof to headers.

**Compose‑CAL.**
• Policy P says in Plain terms: “for every **AuthenticatedRequest** in the **target context**, deny the call when **riskScore** is at or above the set **risk threshold** and **budgetSlack** is at or below the set **budget limit**.”
• Another service S expects `PCIRequest`. Typed pre‑check: does `AuthenticatedRequest ⊑ PCIRequest`? No.
• Remedy: adapter A proves `AuthenticatedRequest → PCIRequest` in this Context; if reusing across Contexts, publish a **KindBridge** for the PCI taxonomy with **`CL^k=2`** (loss: token class collapsed).

**CT2R‑LOG.**
• State P in a state P in a proof‑checked logic (where appropriate for F7+), so that changes to token rules break proofs. Proofs rely on the **AuthenticatedRequest** definition, not on the consumer’s scope.

**Role‑CAL.**
• Register a **RoleMask** over `PCIRequest` for the consuming team; guards must be able to test the mask’s constraints at gate time.

**Outcome.**
• **Typed guard** approves only when: (i) the type pre‑check passes (same‑Context subkind‑of or a KindBridge with an acceptable congruence level), (ii) **Scope** covers the target context (API v2.3, explicit time selector), and (iii) **R** reflects the **scope‑bridge** and **kind‑bridge** penalties and evidence is fresh.
• No one widened Scope to hide a type mismatch; the adapter + bridge made the semantics explicit and auditable.


> **Takeaway.** If you keep these six hand‑offs in view—words → kinds → structure → composition → logic → roles—you get **predictable reviews**, **clean risk accounting**, and **reusable claims** that travel across Contexts without silent meaning drift.
## Compliance & Regulatory Alignment — profile

Treat regulatory categories as **Kinds**, carry their **intent** in `KindSignature` with declared **F**, move them across Contexts with a **KindBridge** (type‑congruence **`CL^k`** + loss notes), and express applicability as **Claim scope** over `U.ContextSlice` (with explicit **Γ_time**). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** via **Ψ(`CL^k`)** (kind) and **Φ(CL)** (scope); **F** and **G** remain unchanged.

> **Authoritative obligations and guard macros** (C‑REG‑1…8, Guard_RegAdopt / Guard_RegChange / Guard_RegXContextUse) and worked scenarios live in **C.3.A, Annex A (Regulatory adoption profile)**.
## How typed reasoning plugs into Assurance Lanes (VA/LA/TA) & Evidence design

**Intent (manager’s view).** Typed reasoning turns “prove/test/qualify” into a **repeatable plan** by making *what the rule talks about* explicit (named **Kinds**, their **subkinds**, optional **RoleMasks**) and keeping **Scope (G)** over `U.ContextSlice` separate from **membership** inside the slice. Cross‑context uncertainty (Scope Bridge **CL**, KindBridge **`CL^k`**) always routes to **R** as penalties **Φ/Ψ**; it never changes **F** or **G**.

**Evidence matrix (sketch).**

| Row set                       | Column set                                                   | Cell content                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kinds** (subkinds or masks) | **Context slices** (Standard versions, env ranges, `Γ_time`) | **Evidence unit** (proof fragment, test batch, monitoring window), with **Scope** and **MemberOf** predicates attached |

*Tip.* For formal kinds and “up‑to‑iso” kinds (AT K2/K3), expect **more rows** (variants). For instance‑like kinds (AT K0), expect **fewer rows** and **tighter columns** (narrow slices, stricter freshness).

> **Authoritative evidence obligations and guard macros** (planning/attachment, VA/LA/TA duties, anti‑patterns) are in **C.3.A, Annex B**.
## How typed reasoning plugs into ESG and Method–Work gating

> Intent. Make state changes and work admissions deterministic, auditable, and safe by separating (1) **typed compatibility** (what the statement or capability is about) from (2) **scope coverage** (where it holds or can run). Any Cross‑context uncertainty is routed to **R** (reliability) only—never to **F** (form) or **G** (scope).

### Scope & fit

This subsection defines **normative guard obligations** for:

* **ESG** (Episteme State Graph) transitions whose assertions **quantify over kinds**, and
* **Method–Work** admissions where a **capability** expects inputs/outputs of specified kinds.

It reuses:

* **USM** (A.2.6): `U.ClaimScope` (G) and `U.WorkScope` coverage + `Γ_time`,
* **Kind‑CAL core** (C.3.1–C.3.2): `U.Kind`, `MemberOf(e,k,slice)`, `⊑`,
* **KindBridge** (C.3.3) with **`CL^k`** and loss notes,
* **Scope Bridge** (Part B) with **CL** and loss notes,
* **RoleMask** (C.3.4) when local adaptations of a kind are used,
* **Formality F** (C.2.3) when transitions gate on rigor,
* **Assurance R** (C.2.2) for evidence freshness and penalties Φ/Ψ.

**Guard macros.** The **normative guard shapes** for ESG and Method–Work (**Guard_TypedClaim**, **Guard_TypedJoin**, **Guard_MaskedUse**, **Guard_XContext_Typed**) are specified in **Annex C.3.A**. Use those shapes; the present section is a manager‑level overview only.
### Inputs & roles (at guard time)

* **TargetSlice** — the specific context you are deciding for: Context, versioned Standards, environment parameters, and an explicit **time selector (Γ_time)**.
* **Typed carriers**

  * **ESG:** the **Claim** quantifies over one or more **Kinds** (e.g., “for all vehicles in the target context …”).
  * **Method–Work:** the **Capability** declares expected input/output kinds (and possibly RoleMasks).
* **Thresholds** (context‑local policy):

  * Minimum **F** level for the Claim (if the Context gates on rigor),
  * Minimum **congruence** for **scope bridges**,
  * Minimum **type‑congruence** for **KindBridges**,
  * Evidence **freshness windows** (R‑lane).
* **Evidence bundle** (if the transition implies trust): references, dates, windows.
### Manager’s 7‑step checklist (operational)

1. **Name the slice.** Write the full `TargetSlice`/`JobSlice` tuple including **`Γ_time`**.
2. **Check coverage.** Claim/Work scope **covers** the slice (USM).
3. **Check typed definedness.** A deterministic membership check is available in this context for every kind you use (and any masks are registered).
4. **Check typed compatibility.** same Context: `⊑` (or mask constraints met). Cross‑context: **KindBridge** with **`CL^k ≥ c`**.
5. **Bridge scope if needed.** Scope Bridge with **CL ≥ c** for Cross‑context scope.
6. **Apply penalties to R.** Apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** and the **kind‑bridge penalty**; then check evidence **freshness** windows.
7. **(If gated) Check F.** Enforce `Formality ≥ F_k` for the transition.

> **Remember:** **F** and **G** never change because of bridges; only **R** is penalized. AT (K0…K3) is informative and **not** used in guards.
### Cross‑references

* **USM / A.2.6:** Scope coverage, `Γ_time`, serial **∩**, **SpanUnion**, Bridge+CL.
* **Kind‑CAL / C.3.1–C.3.4:** `U.Kind`, `⊑`, `MemberOf`, RoleMask, KindBridge + **`CL^k`**.
* **Formality / C.2.3:** `U.Formality` thresholds (when ESG gates on rigor).
* **Assurance / C.2.2:** Freshness windows; **Φ(CL)** and **Ψ(`CL^k`)** penalties to **R** (weakest‑link on paths).

This subsection is **normative** for guards in ESG and Method–Work that **use kinds**.
