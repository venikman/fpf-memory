# G.Core:4.5 - ID continuity protocol (Δ‑discipline)
> Preface node `heading:g-core-4-5-id-continuity-protocol-discipline:54567`

## Content

When moving universal norms out of `G.x` into `G.Core`:

* existing public CC ids in `G.x` that may be referenced externally SHALL NOT be deleted or renamed;
* such CC items SHALL become **delegation** items that point to the relevant `CC‑GCORE‑…` item(s);
* each `G.x` SHALL add exactly one bridge CC item `CC‑Gx‑CoreRef` (first in its CC list) that makes linked `CC‑GCORE‑…` items mandatory for `G.x` conformance.

Legacy trigger tokens (e.g., `G.11:T*`, `G.6:H3:*`) are preserved as aliases and MUST map to canonical trigger kinds.

Non-CC public identifiers (e.g., `UTSRowId`, `RSCRTriggerAliasId`, deprecation notices, edition bumps) MUST obey the same Δ-discipline: preserve old ids; represent drift via alias/deprecation/edition evolution (see `F.17 (UTS)`); and emit canonical trigger kinds (`RSCRTriggerKindId.TokenizationOrNameChange`, `RSCRTriggerKindId.EditionPinChange`) when downstream impact is possible.
