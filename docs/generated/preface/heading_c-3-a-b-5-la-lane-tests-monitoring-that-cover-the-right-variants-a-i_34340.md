## Content

**What LA contributes.** Empirical assurance for claims with executable semantics or physical interfaces; especially when F ≤ F6 or when stochastic/real‑world effects matter.

**LA‑patterns (informative):**

* **Cover by subkind.** Test at least one representative per subkind; add more where variability inside a subkind matters.
* **Boundary probing.** Concentrate tests near **KindSignature** and **Scope** boundaries (e.g., temp limits, speed caps).
* **Hybrid checks (F6).** When software controllers interact with physical systems, ensure **both sides** declare obligations; include their interaction cases in the matrix.
* **Monitoring windows.** For live systems, define **Γ\_time policies** (e.g., rolling 30 d) and tie alerts to **kind‑aware metrics** (“error rate per `ServiceInstance`”).

**LA‑obligations (normative):**

* **LA‑1.** Each test campaign **SHALL** specify **rows/columns** in the evidence matrix and attach **Scope/MemberOf** predicates to each run.
* **LA‑2.** Freshness windows **SHALL** be explicit and enforced in guards (no “latest”).
* **LA‑3.** If a **KindBridge** merges subkinds, test plans **SHALL** be adjusted (more cells, stricter acceptance), and the **kind‑bridge penalty** (based on CL^k) applied to **R**.
* **LA‑4.** Publishing **SpanUnion** coverage requires the independence note (which support lines differ).

**Mini‑example (LA).**
Claim: “For all `x ∈ Vehicle`: brakeDistance ≤ 50 m on dry, ≤ 40 m on wet.”
— **Rows**: `{PassengerCar, LightTruck}`.
— **Columns**: `{dry, ≤50}`, `{wet, ≤40}` with rigs and versions.
— **Cells**: PC/dry covered by track tests; LT/wet by simulation + surrogate tests (independent lines → SpanUnion allowed).
— **Bridge** to jurisdiction Y collapses EV vs ICE ⇒ `CL^k=2`. Apply **Ψ(2)** to **R**; add extra wet tests to compensate.
