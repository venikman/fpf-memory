# Part K – Lexical debt
> Preface node `heading:part-k-lexical-debt:60576`

## Content

## Mandatory replacement map for measurement terms

> **Rule:** In all **normative** content (specifications, data schemas, etc.), the deprecated terms **“axis”** and **“dimension”** (and their plural or compound forms) **MUST NOT** be used to denote a measurable aspect. Use **Characteristic** in the Tech register instead. Other colloquial terms should be mapped to canonical terms as listed below. In **Plain** narrative, the legacy words may appear _only on first use_ and only if paired with their canonical equivalent for clarity.

| Legacy Term (context) | **Replace with** (Tech register) | Plain register allowance | Canonical Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| axis (of measurement); dimension (of a system or quality) | **(disallowed in Core prose)** → use **Characteristic** | No parenthetical allowance in Core; use **Characteristic / Measure / Coordinate** only | A.17 (CHR-NORM) |
| point (on an axis); data point | **Coordinate** (on a Scale) | “point” _(in explanations only, e.g. “a point on the scale”)_ | A.18 (CSLC-KERNEL) |
| metric value; raw score | **Coordinate** (or **Value**) | “value” _(acceptable in plain usage when context is clear, but formally it’s a Coordinate tied to a Characteristic)_ | A.18, C.16 |
| score (composite or normalized) | **Score** (produced via a **ScoringMethod**) | “score” _(if needed in narrative, ensure it’s explained as a result of a defined ScoringMethod)_ | A.17/A.18 (ScoringMethod/Score) |
| unit dimension; unit axis | **Unit** (of a Scale) | “unit” _(plain usage okay)_ | A.18 (Scale/Unit) |
| metric (as a noun) | **Avoid in Tech and as primitive** → use **`U.DHCMethodRef` / `U.Measure` / Score** | “metric” _(Plain only on first use, with pointer to canonical terms)_ | C.16 § 5.1 (L5), A.18 |
## Migration debt from A.2.6 (Scope, ClaimScope, WorkScope)

### Deprecations (normative)

The following terms **MUST NOT** name scope objects in normative text, guards, or conformance blocks:

* *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *capability envelope*, *validity* (as a characteristic name).

Use instead:

* **`U.ClaimScope`** (*Claim scope*, nick **G**) for epistemes;
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) for capabilities;
* **`U.Scope`** only when explaining the abstract mechanism (not in guards).
### Affected locations and required edits (normative)

Editors SHALL apply the following replacements:

1. **Part C.2.2 (F–G–R).**

   * Replace any internal definition of “Generality” with a normative reference to **A.2.6 §6.3** (*Claim scope (G)*).
   * Where “abstraction level” is mentioned as G, replace with “Claim scope (where the claim holds)”; keep **AT** (AbstractionTier) only as optional didactics (non‑G).
   * Ensure composition examples use **intersection/SpanUnion** for G, not ordinal “more/less general”.

2. **Part C.2.3 (Formality F).**

   * No change to F itself.
   * Any example that implies “raising F widens G” MUST be rephrased: F changes expression form; G changes only via **ΔG**.

3. **Part A.2.2 (Capabilities).**

   * Replace “capability envelope/applicability” with **`U.WorkScope`**.
   * Method–Work gates MUST test **Work scope covers JobSlice**, with **measures** and **qualification windows** bound.

4. **Part B (Bridges & CL).**

   * Add a note: **CL penalties apply to R**, not to **F/G**; mapping MAY recommend **narrowing** the mapped scope (best practice).

5. **Part E (Lexicon).**

   * Add entries for **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Scope** (mechanism).
   * Mark listed deprecated terms as **legacy aliases** allowed only in explanatory notes.

6. **ESG & Method–Work templates.**

   * Replace any “applicability”/“envelope” guard phrasing with **ScopeCoverage** (see §10).
   * Require explicit **`Γ_time`** selectors in all scope‑sensitive guards.
### Migration playbook (informative)

1. **Inventory** scope‑like phrases across your Context (search: applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope, valid\*).
2. **Classify** each occurrence as **Claim scope** (episteme) or **Work scope** (capability); replace any “scope characteristic(s)” with “scope object”, “scope type”, or “USM scope object” depending on sentence grammar.
3. **Rewrite** guards to use `Scope covers TargetSlice` + explicit **`Γ_time`**; remove “latest”.
4. **Publish** any required **Bridges** with **CL** for Cross‑context usage.
5. **Document** ΔG changes separately from evidence freshness (R).
### Backwards compatibility (informative)

Legacy artifacts MAY keep their historical phrasing in body prose. All **guards, conformance checklists, and state assertions** MUST be rewritten to the USM terms and semantics.
### Change Log (normative migration record)

* **A.2.6 introduced.** Defines `U.ContextSlice`, `U.Scope`, `U.ClaimScope (G)`, `U.WorkScope`; sets algebra and guard patterns.
* **Deprecated labels.** “applicability / envelope / generality / capability envelope / validity” as characteristic names.
* **Edits required.** C.2.2 (G = Claim scope), A.2.2 (Work scope for capabilities), Part B (CL→R note), Part E (Lexicon updates), ESG/Method–Work guard templates (ScopeCoverage + `Γ_time`).
* **No change.** C.2.3 (F) unchanged; its examples updated only for wording consistency.
