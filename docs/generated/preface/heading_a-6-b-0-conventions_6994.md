## Content

**Keywords.** The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**, and **SHALL** are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119/8174. Lower‑case “must/may/should” in explanatory prose is descriptive, not normative.

**Quadrant labels.** This pattern uses the routing labels **L / A / D / E** as *statement quadrants*:

* **L** — Laws & Definitions
* **A** — Admissibility & Gates
* **D** — Deontics & Commitments
* **E** — Work‑Effects & Evidence

These labels are **routing labels for statements**, not MVPK face kinds and not pattern identifiers.

**Statement identifiers (recommended).** Routable statements **SHOULD** be given stable IDs with a quadrant prefix: `L-*`, `A-*`, `D-*`, `E-*`. Other sections and views **SHOULD** reference these IDs rather than restating the same constraint in new words.

**Non-collision note (informative).** The `A-*` prefix here is “Admissibility”, not Part‑A numbering and not MVPK’s `AssuranceLane` face kind. If this is a readability hazard in your program, prefer an explicit `G-*` (“Gate”) local convention while keeping the quadrant name “Admissibility”. Also avoid introducing single‑letter mnemonics for MVPK face kinds inside this cluster (MVPK has a legacy L,P,D,E mnemonic); spell face kinds in full to reduce collisions.

**Atomic claim.** An **atomic claim** is a sentence (or bullet) that performs exactly one logical role and is routable to exactly one quadrant. If a sentence mixes roles, it is **not atomic** and **MUST** be split before it can be routed.

**Adjudication substrate (for routing).** For the purposes of this square, an atomic claim is classified by the primary substrate that decides its satisfaction:

* **In‑description / in‑theory**: satisfaction is decided from the description alone (e.g., proof/type validation), or the claim is itself a governance utterance whose content is fully determined by the text.
* **In‑work / in‑execution**: deciding satisfaction requires observing executed work and/or inspecting carriers produced in work.

**Note (important).** `D-*` claims are authored and interpreted in the description; whether they are met is typically established indirectly via referenced `E-*` claims (or other governance procedures). This does not move `D-*` into quadrant E; it clarifies the routing axis.

**Modality family.** A claim is either:

* **Truth‑conditional**: definitions, invariants, typing rules (“is”, “iff”, “∀”).
* **Governance**: permissions, prohibitions, obligations, commitments (“MUST/SHOULD/MAY”, “is permitted”, “is forbidden”, “commits to”).
