## Content

FPF does not assume people will speak in fully‑typed relational algebra on day one. Early thought is sketchy, and that is healthy. What matters is having a repeatable upgrade path—a way to go from “useful but ambiguous” to “auditable and reusable” when a statement starts carrying load.

That upgrade is often called “formalization” in everyday speech, but in FPF it is a **semantic precision upgrade**: a small workflow that turns compressed language into structure you can reason about. “Formalization” is only one internal step: choosing a stable mathematical substrate so the reasoning cannot collapse back into vibes.

A good precision upgrade tends to follow five moves:

1. **Notice the triggers.** Umbrella verbs (“sync/align/ground/depends”), pronouns (“it/this”), and metonymic endpoints (“the service”, “production”) are not sins; they are alarms that a richer ontic fragment is hiding underneath.
2. **Unpack the ontic fragment.** Make the local mini‑ontology explicit: which kinds, roles, scopes, viewpoints, time selections, and evidence objects are actually in play.
3. **Put a stable mathematical object under it.** Choose a structure with known behaviour—record types with named slots, typed n‑ary relations / hyperedges, partial orders, lattices, graphs, effect signatures—so future edits become well‑posed transformations rather than rewrites of prose.
4. **Refactor the ontology to fit the substrate.** Split bundled notions, make participant positions explicit, declare invariants, and introduce named change classes for “what changed?” (retarget vs revise vs rescope, etc.).
5. **Mint precise lexemes and guardrails.** Give the refined concepts specific names and keep them paired across registers (Tech/Plain twins via **LEX‑BUNDLE**, E.10). Add lexical firewalls so the umbrella words don’t silently re‑enter and collapse distinctions again.

In the spec this precision‑upgrade move is captured as a family recipe (**A.6.P**, Relational Precision Restoration) and then specialised for recurring boundary pain points (slot discipline, basedness declarations, service polysemy, cross‑context “same”, contract unpacking). The point is not to ban natural language; the point is to make natural language *upgradeable*.

A tiny example illustrates the intent:

Before (fast speech): “We synced the model with production.”  
After (precision‑restored): declare *which* relation kind holds between *which* endpoints, under *which* scope/time/viewpoint, with *which* admissible change classes—and publish a Plain gloss that maps back to the Tech token.

Once the relation has a kind, slots, qualifiers, and a change lexicon, you can do what modern SoTA engineering expects: evolve it safely, compare editions, automate checks, and still keep the story readable for humans.
