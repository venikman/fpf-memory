# A.2.9:4.2 — Minimal structure (normative)
> Preface node `heading:a-2-9-4-2-minimal-structure-normative:5131`

## Content

A conforming `U.SpeechAct` **SHALL** be representable by the following minimal record (field names are illustrative; the constraints are normative):

```
U.SpeechAct <: U.Work

Invariant: U.Work.kind = Communicative

U.SpeechAct ::=
  U.Work
  & {
      actTypes: set<SpeechActTypeRef>,               // ≥1 act types (supports multi-function)
      addressedTo: optional<set<AddresseeRef>>,      // optional: who is addressed / audience
      utteranceRefs: optional<set<DescriptionRef>>,  // where the utterance content is stated/recorded (A.7: Description)
      carrierRefs: optional<set<CarrierRef>>,        // evidence carriers/traces (A.7: Carrier; use A.10 when evidentiary)
      institutes: optional<InstitutedEffects>,       // references to objects/claims instituted/updated by this act
      notes: optional<InformativeText>               // explicitly informative
    }

DescriptionRef ::=
  ClaimIdRef | EpistemeRef
  // Pointer to an utterance description (e.g., spec clause claim ID, a policy episteme, a message-content episteme).

SpeechActTypeRef ::=
  ContextLocalTokenRef
  // Must be defined/recognized in the Work’s judgement context (bounded context).

AddresseeRef ::=
  PartyRef | RoleRef | RoleAssignmentRef

InstitutedEffects ::=
  {
    commitments: optional<set<CommitmentIdRef>>,
    roleAssignments: optional<set<RoleAssignmentRef>>,
    statusClaims: optional<set<ClaimIdRef>>,         // e.g., “StandardStatus=Approved” if modeled as claims
    other: optional<set<ObjectIdRef>>
  }
```

**Normative constraints:**

* **(SA‑C0) Work conformance applies.** Because `U.SpeechAct <: U.Work`, a speech‑act record **MUST** satisfy `U.Work` conformance (A.15.1), including the required anchors (`isExecutionOf`, `performedBy`, `executedWithin`, `window`, and state‑plane / judgement‑context anchoring). A speech act **MUST** have at least one `affected` referent (the thing it is *about/updates*), even if it is purely governance‑state.
* **(SA‑C1) PerformedBy must be an accountable actor.** `performedBy` **MUST** resolve to a `RoleAssignmentRef` whose holder is an accountable system/party in the named scope. It **MUST NOT** be a spec/interface/document as an episteme.
* **(SA‑C2) ActTypes are required and context-local.** `actTypes` **MUST** contain at least one `SpeechActTypeRef` recognized in the Work’s judgement context (local meaning). Free‑text verbs are nonconformant unless registered as a context token.
* **(SA‑C3) Time honesty.** `window` **MUST** be explicit (or inherited from the parent `U.Work` record) so freshness rules can be evaluated.
* **(SA‑C4) If used for gating/audit, it must be observable.** If a speech act is used as a checklist criterion, guard condition, or provenance hook for a `U.Commitment`, the model **SHALL** include at least one observable handle: `utteranceRefs` and/or `carrierRefs`. When the act is used as evidence, at least one carrier reference **SHOULD** be SCR/RSCR‑resolvable per A.10.
* **(SA‑C5) Institutional effects are references, not paraphrases.** When the act is intended to institute/update commitments, role assignments, or statuses, `institutes.*` **SHOULD** reference the corresponding object IDs/claim IDs rather than restating content.
* **(SA‑C6) Cross-context use is Bridge-only.** If a `SpeechActRef` is used for checking/gating/provenance in a **different bounded context** than the act’s judgement context, the referencing object **MUST** satisfy the spec’s cross-context discipline by citing an explicit Bridge/policy that licenses the interpretation (and surfacing congruence vs loss where applicable), rather than assuming equivalence by label.
