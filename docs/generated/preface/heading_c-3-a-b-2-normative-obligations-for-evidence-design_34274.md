# C.3.A:B.2 Normative obligations for evidence design
> Preface node `heading:c-3-a-b-2-normative-obligations-for-evidence-design:34274`

## Content

**EA‑1 (Two checks).** Every VA/LA artifact that supports a typed claim **SHALL** bind **both**:

* **Scope predicate**: `U.ClaimScope(Claim) covers TargetSlice` (with explicit `Γ_time`), and
* **Kind predicate**: `MemberOf(?, k, TargetSlice)` is **defined** (deterministic).

**EA‑2 (Subkind coverage).** When a claim quantifies over `k`, target‑contexts **SHALL** justify LA coverage **per relevant subkind** of `k` (or **per RoleMask** if masks stand in for stable subkinds). “Representative set” **MUST** be stated explicitly.

**EA‑3 (Independence for unions).** If a published **SpanUnion** of evidence lines is used to enlarge covered area, **independence** of lines **SHALL** be documented (no shared weakest link).

**EA‑4 (Bridges accounted).** If a VA/LA artifact travels across Contexts:

* **Scope movement** **SHALL** use a Scope Bridge (Part B) with **CL** and apply the **scope‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
* **Kind movement** **SHALL** use a **KindBridge** (§ C.3.3) with **CL^k** and apply the **kind‑bridge penalty** to **R**.
  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** or **G**.

  Neither movement **SHALL** alter **F** nor **G**.

**EA‑5 (Freshness).** LA evidence **SHALL** declare freshness windows tied to `Γ_time` (no implicit “latest”). Expiry **MUST** fail guards closed until refreshed.

**EA‑6 (No scope‑by‑wording).** Editors **MUST NOT** widen **G** by rewriting a claim to sound “more general.” Widening **G** (ΔG+) is permitted **only** with new support that truly enlarges the set of slices.

**EA‑7 (TA separation).** Tool qualification (TA) **SHALL** be tracked independently. VA/LA guards **MUST NOT** substitute “tool is trusted” for content proof/coverage.
