## Content

Editors SHALL apply the following replacements:

1. **Part C.2.2 (F–G–R).**

   * Replace any internal definition of “Generality” with a normative reference to **A.2.6 §6.3** (*Claim scope (G)*).
   * Where “abstraction level” is mentioned as G, replace with “Claim scope (where the claim holds)”; keep **AT** (AbstractionTier) only as optional didactics (non‑G).
   * Ensure composition examples use **intersection/SpanUnion** for G, not ordinal “more/less general”.

2. **Part C.2.3 (Formality F).**

   * No change to F itself.
   * Any example that implies “raising F widens G” MUST be rephrased: F changes expression form; G changes only via **ΔG**.

3. **Part A.2.2 (Capabilities).**

   * Replace “capability envelope/applicability” with **`U.WorkScope`**.
   * Method–Work gates MUST test **Work scope covers JobSlice**, with **measures** and **qualification windows** bound.

4. **Part B (Bridges & CL).**

   * Add a note: **CL penalties apply to R**, not to **F/G**; mapping MAY recommend **narrowing** the mapped scope (best practice).

5. **Part E (Lexicon).**

   * Add entries for **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Scope** (mechanism).
   * Mark listed deprecated terms as **legacy aliases** allowed only in explanatory notes.

6. **ESG & Method–Work templates.**

   * Replace any “applicability”/“envelope” guard phrasing with **ScopeCoverage** (see §10).
   * Require explicit **`Γ_time`** selectors in all scope‑sensitive guards.
