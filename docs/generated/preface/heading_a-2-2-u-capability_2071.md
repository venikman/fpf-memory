# A.2.2 — U.Capability
> Preface node `heading:a-2-2-u-capability:2071`

## Content

## Context (plain‑language motivation)

In real projects we must answer two different questions:

* **“Can this system do X?”** — this is about an **ability** inherent to the system.
* **“Is this system assigned to do X here and now?”** — this is about an **assignment** (a **Role assignment**) inside a bounded context.

Teams frequently blur the two, and then further mix them with **how** the work is done (the **Method**) and **what actually happened** (the **Work**). `U.Capability` isolates **ability as a first‑class concept** so that you can plan realistically, staff responsibly, and audit cleanly.
## Problem (what goes wrong without this concept)

1. **Permission ≠ ability.** A Role assignment authorizes execution in a context; it does **not** prove the system can meet the required **WorkScope** and **WorkMeasures**.
2. **Recipe ≠ ability.** A Method says *how* to do something; it does not guarantee that *this* holder can meet the target outcomes under the required constraints.
3. **Execution log ≠ ability.** A past Work record does not, by itself, establish a stable ability; conditions may have been favorable or unique.
4. **Cross‑team confusion.** Enterprise terms like “capability”, “service”, and the old “function” are used interchangeably; planning, staffing, and assurance become fragile.
## Forces (what we must balance)

| Force                                   | Tension we resolve                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Stability vs. change**                | Ability is a relatively stable property of a system, yet it evolves with upgrades, wear, calibration, and environment.               |
| **Universality vs. domain‑specificity** | One universal notion must serve robots, teams, and software services, while letting each domain keep its own performance vocabulary. |
| **Evidence vs. simplicity**             | We want an ability claim to be evidence‑backed, but the core idea must stay simple enough for planning conversations.                |
| **Local conditions vs. reusability**    | Ability depends on conditions (inputs, environment); still, the concept must be reusable across contexts via explicit scoping.       |
## Solution — define the ability explicitly

### A.2.2:4.1 Definition

**`U.Capability`** is a **dispositional property of a `U.System`** that states its **ability to produce a class of outcomes** (i.e., execute a class of Work) **within a declared `U.WorkScope` (conditions/assumptions) and meeting stated `U.WorkMeasures`**. It is **not** an assignment (Role), **not** a recipe (Method), and **not** an execution (Work).

> **One-liner to remember:** *Capability = “can do (within its **WorkScope** and measures)”*, independent of *“is assigned now”* or *“did do at time t”*.

**Capability declaration (summary).** A capability SHALL declare, as **separate** items:
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) — the set of `U.ContextSlice` under which the capability can deliver the intended `U.Work` (see **A.2.6 §6.4**);
* **`U.WorkMeasures`** — measurable targets with units evaluated on a **JobSlice** (R‑lane facet);
* **`U.QualificationWindow`** — the time policy that governs operational admissibility at **`Γ_time`** (R‑lane facet).
**Note.** This separation supersedes the legacy “envelope + measures + validity interval” bundle. **Work scope is the set of conditions (USM), not a Characteristic; measures are CHR‑characteristics; capability packages both.**

**Reminder (measurement & scope).** *WorkScope* is a **set‑valued USM object** (membership, set algebra) and **not** a CHR Characteristic; *WorkMeasures* are **CHR Characteristics** with declared scales/units. **Admission checks these separately** (see § 10.3 WG‑2/WG‑3).
### A.2.2:4.2 Conceptual descriptors (not a data schema)

When you describe a capability in a model or a review, anchor it by answering these five didactic prompts:

1. **Holder:** *Whose ability is this?* → a specific `U.System`.
2. **Context:** *In which bounded context were the measures established?* → `U.BoundedContext` (strongly recommended for clarity and comparability).
3. **Task family:** *Ability to do **what kind** of work?* → reference the relevant **MethodDescription**(s) or method family the system can execute.
4. **WorkScope:** *Under what conditions?* → inputs/resources/environment assumptions (e.g., voltage, pressure, ambient, tool head).
5. **Performance measures:** *With what bounds?* → CHR‑style measures (throughput, precision, latency, reliability, MTBF…) with ranges/targets.

Optional descriptors that improve trust without adding bureaucracy:

* **QualificationWindow:** calibration/qualification window for the stated **WorkScope** (abilities drift).
* **Evidence:** links to test reports, certifications, prior Work summaries (as **Episteme**).
* **Degradation/upgrade notes:** known change points that affect the **WorkScope**.

> **Didactic guardrail:** Capabilities are stated in **positive, measurable terms** (“can weld seam type W at ±0.2 mm up to 12/min at 18 °C–30 °C”). Avoid role words (“welder”) or recipe detail (step flows) here.
### A.2.2:4.3 Shorthand for everyday speech

To keep discussions terse yet precise, teams often write:

* **“S#17 can \<MethodDescription / task family> @ \<WorkScope> → \<measures>.”**
* Or as a bullet in a capability table scoped to a context, e.g., *AssemblyLine\_2025 Capability Sheet*.

This is not a formal notation—just a consistent way to keep the five prompts in view.
## Clear distinctions (litmus tests managers can apply)

| If you are talking about…                  | Use                     | Litmus test                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **assignment** (who is being what, where) | **Role → Role assignment** | Can you reassign to another holder without changing the system’s composition? If yes → Role. |
| **Ability** (can do within bounds)         | **Capability**          | Would you still say “can do” even if not currently assigned? If yes → Capability.           |
| **Recipe** (how‑to)                        | **Method / MethodDescription** | Has inputs/outputs and steps but no date/time.                                               |
| **Execution** (what happened)              | **Work**                | Has a start/end, consumed resources, left a log.                                             |
| **External promise**                       | **Promise content (service promise clause)** | Framed as “we provide/guarantee to others.”                                                  |
| **Law/model of change**                    | **Dynamics**            | Describes state evolution, not an ability of one system.                                     |

**Two useful corollaries**

* A step in a Method may **require** a Role; **optionally** it may also stipulate a **capability threshold** (e.g., precision ≤ 0.2 mm). assignment and ability are checked separately.
* A promise content clause depends on **having** the needed capabilities **and** being **assigned/committed** to deliver under the clause’s context (bind as `U.Commitment` when it is an obligation).
## Archetypal grounding (parallel structural and organizational examples)

### A.2.2:6.1 Physical system on a line (structural example)

* **Holder:** `RobotArm_A` (`U.System`).
* **Task family:** seam welding per `Weld_MIG_v3` **MethodDescription**.
* **WorkScope:** workpiece steel grades S235–S355; ambient 18–30 °C; argon mix 92–95 %; torch T‑MIG‑07.
* **Measures:** bead width 6.0 mm ± 0.2 mm; throughput ≤ 12 seams/min; defect rate < 0.5 %.
* **Context:** `AssemblyLine_2025`.
* **Readable claim:** *RobotArm\_A can execute Weld\_MIG\_v3 within the stated **WorkScope** at the stated measures (AssemblyLine\_2025).*
* **What this is not:** It is **not** “the welder”—that is a **Role assignment** when assigned on a shift. It is **not** the weld recipe— that is the **MethodDescription**.
### A.2.2:6.2 Software service in operations (structural, cyber-physical)

* **Holder:** `PlannerService_v4` (deployed system).
* **Task family:** job‑shop schedule generation per `JS_Schedule_v4` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** 50–500 jobs; 5–40 machines; hard deadlines only; network latency ≤ 20 ms.
* **Measures:** schedule completion within 0.95 of theoretical optimum (benchmark set), 98 % on‑time delivery in simulation.
* **Context:** `PlantScheduling_2025`.
* **Use:** Steps that “require ScheduleGeneration capability ≥ 0.90 optimality” will only pass if the holder’s capability meets or exceeds that bound.
### A.2.2:6.3 Organizational unit (enterprise sense)

* **Holder:** `FinanceDept` (`U.System` as OrgUnit).
* **Task family:** period close per `CloseBooks_v3` MethodDescription.
* **WorkScope:** IFRS; ERP v12; 8 legal entities; staffing ≥ 6 FTE; cut‑off rules X.
* **Measures:** close in ≤ 5 business days; adjustment error rate < 0.2 %.
* **Context:** `OperatingModel_2025`.
* **Distinction:** This is **ability**; the **service promise clause** “Provide month‑end close” is the external promise derived from this ability once formally offered.
## Bias‑Annotation (as in cluster‑E patterns)

* **Lenses tested:** `Arch`, `Prag`, `Did`, `Epist`.
* **Scope declaration:** Universal; holder constrained to `U.System`.
* **Rationale:** Gives the kernel a clean, reusable **ability concept** so Role (assignment), Method (recipe), Work (execution), and promise content (external promise clause) do not collapse into each other. Keeps planning talk truthful and checkable without introducing governance machinery here. **`U.Capability`** is a **dispositional property of a `U.System`** that states its **ability to produce a class of outcomes** (i.e., execute a class of Work) **within a declared `U.WorkScope` (conditions/assumptions) and meeting stated `U.WorkMeasures`**.
## Conformance Checklist (normative)

**CC‑A2.2‑1 (Holder type).**
A capability **belongs to** a **`U.System`** (physical, cyber, socio‑technical, or organizational). Capabilities are **not** assigned to `U.Episteme`.

**CC‑A2.2‑2 (Separation of concerns).**
A capability is **not** a Role, **not** a Method/MethodDescription, **not** a Work, and **not** a promise content clause (`U.PromiseContent`). Models **SHALL NOT** use capability declarations to stand in for assignments, recipes, executions, or promises.

**CC‑A2.2‑3 (WorkScope required for operational use).**
When a capability is used to qualify a step or to support planning, its statement **MUST** name a **WorkScope** (conditions/assumptions) and **WorkMeasures** (targets/ranges). **Guards that admit Work MUST test** that the **holder’s WorkScope covers the step’s JobSlice** (i.e., `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice`) **and that WorkMeasures meet the step’s thresholds, with an explicit `Γ_time` window bound**. Without a WorkScope and measures, a capability is advisory and **SHALL NOT** be used for step admission or assurance claims.

**CC‑A2.2‑4 (Context anchor).**
Capability statements that drive operational decisions **MUST** be anchored to a **`U.BoundedContext`** (the “Context” whose vocabulary and test norms apply).

**CC‑A2.2‑5 (QualificationWindow).**
When capabilities are used operationally (e.g., to gate Work), the statement **MUST** carry a **QualificationWindow** (calibration window, software version window, etc.) and the guard **MUST name the `Γ_time` window** used for the check. Outside the QualificationWindow, the claim is not admissible for gating.

**CC‑A2.2‑6 (Past work remains past).**
Updates to a capability statement **SHALL NOT** retroactively invalidate already recorded Work. Past Work is judged against the capability declaration that was valid **at the time of execution**.

**CC‑A2.2‑7 (Threshold checks are orthogonal to roles).**
A step that requires both a Role and a capability threshold admits a Work only if **both** are satisfied: (i) the performer’s **Role assignment** is active in the step window; (ii) the **holder’s capability** meets or exceeds the threshold **with `WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice` and within the **QualificationWindow** at the named **`Γ_time`**.**

**CC‑A2.2‑8 (Derived capabilities).**
If a capability is claimed for a **composite system** (assembled by Γ), the claim **MUST** be stated as a property of that composite holder (not of its parts) with clear dependency notes (e.g., “valid while Subsystem B meets X”). Details of derivation belong to the context’s methodology, not to this definition.

**CC‑A2.2‑9 (No capability for epistemes).**
Algorithms, standards, and documents provide **evidence** or **recipes**; they **do not** “have capability.” Only systems do.

**CC-A2.2-10 (`Γ_time` selector in guards).**
Scope-sensitive guards (including Method–Work gates) **MUST** include an explicit **`Γ_time`** selector indicating the window *W* over which **ScopeCoverage** and **WorkMeasures** are evaluated.
## Capability thresholds on steps (how A.15 uses this concept)

A step in a **Method** may define **required roles** (assignment) and **capability thresholds** (ability). A Work passes the gate if:

1. **assignment check:** the Work’s `performedBy` points to a valid **Role assignment** that covers the step window and satisfies the role relation (including specialization `≤` inside the context).
2. **Ability check:** the **holder** of that Role assignment has a **capability** whose **WorkScope covers the step’s JobSlice** (i.e., declared superset) and whose **WorkMeasures** meet the step’s threshold(s) within `Γ_time(W)` and while the capability’s **QualificationWindow** includes *W*.

**Idioms managers can reuse (plain text):**

* *“S1 requires `IncisionOperatorRole` and Precision ≤ 0.2 mm (OR\_2025 norms) **in window W**.”*
* *“S2 requires `PlannerRole`, **WorkScope ⊇ JobSlice\[W]**, and Optimality ≥ 0.90 on `JS_Schedule_v4`.”*

**What to avoid:**

* Putting “Precision ≤ 0.2 mm” into the Role name. Keep thresholds attached to the **step**; keep **ability** on the **holder**.
## Time and change (calibration, drift, upgrades)

Capabilities are **stable but not static**. Three simple practices keep reasoning honest:

* **Qualification windows.** Abilities drift. Put a **QualificationWindow** on the statement (e.g., “valid for software v4.2; recalibration due 2025-09-30”).
* **Change points.** Note upgrades/downgrades that affect the WorkScope or measures.
* **Snapshot at execution.** When Work is recorded, it is implicitly tied to the **then‑current** capability statement; later edits do not rewrite history (see CC‑A2.2‑6).

**Manager’s rule of thumb:** if you would reschedule a job after a tool change, the capability statement needs a new window.
## Composition and Γ (how assembled systems “can do”)

Γ builds a **new holder** (a composite system). Its capability is not the algebraic sum of parts; it is an **ability of the whole** under its own WorkScope.

* **Express at the whole.** “Cell\_3 can place 12 PCB/min with ±0.1 mm” — that is a capability of **Cell\_3**, not of the pick‑and‑place head alone.
* **State dependencies.** “Valid while Feeder\_A delivers reels at ≥ X; vision subsystem calibrated ≤ 72 h ago.”
* **Constructor vs. transformer.** The **ConstructorRole** builds the composite (Γ); the resulting **TransformerRole** may later act on products. Capability belongs to the holder relevant to the action (builder’s ability vs operator’s ability).
## Interaction with Service Promise Clauses (external promise content)

A **service promise clause** (a `U.PromiseContent`) is a consumer‑facing **external promise statement**. It relies on capability but is not identical to it.

> **Note.** The bare head noun *service* is polysemic; in normative prose it is treated as an **always‑unpack** token. Use A.6.8 (RPR‑SERV) to name the intended facet (promise clause vs endpoint vs work vs commitment).

* **From capability to service promise clause.** You normally **derive** a service promise clause by taking a capability and **fixing** the promise outward (e.g., “We guarantee close ≤ 5 days”).
* **From service promise clause back to capability.** If the promise raises the bar (e.g., tighter SLA), the underlying capability must meet or exceed it under the promise clause’s context.
* **Staffing.** Delivering on a service promise clause still requires **Role assignments**; capability alone does not authorize action.

**Memory aid:** Capability = *can do*; service promise clause = *promise to others that we will do*.
## Interaction with Dynamics (laws vs. abilities)

* **Dynamics** describe **how states evolve** (models, laws, trajectories).
* **Capability** says **what this system can achieve** within an WorkScope.
* Dynamics often serve as **evidence** or **explanatory models** for capability but are **not** the capability itself.

**Physics example:** an “isothermal process” (process here as transformation) is a **Work** instance whose path is explained by a **Dynamics** episteme; a lab rig’s ability to run that path repeatably is its **capability**.
## Anti‑patterns (and the right move)

* **Role‑as‑capability.** “Welder role ensures ±0.2 mm.” → Keep **role** as assignment; put **precision** in a **capability** on the holder; put the **threshold** on the **step**.
* **Recipe‑as‑capability.** “We have the ‘Etch\_Al2O3’ capability.” → Recipe is **Method/MethodDescription**; ability is “can execute Etch\_Al2O3 within WorkScope E at measures M.”
* **Work‑as‑capability.** “We did it once, so we can.” → One Work log is not a stable ability; state envelope and measures if you want a capability claim.
* **Context‑less claims.** “This tool can machine titanium.” → Say **where and under what bounds** (context + WorkScope + measures).
* **Stuffing capabilities into BoM/PBS.** Structure lists **what it is**; capabilities belong to **what it can do** (the holder), not inside the parts list.
* **Service‑as‑capability.** “We have the Month‑end Close capability (promise).” → Promise is a **service promise clause** (`U.PromiseContent`); ability is internal, promise is external.
## Migration notes (quick wins for existing texts)

1. **Underline WorkScopes.** For every “can do” sentence, add **conditions** and **measures**; otherwise treat it as background color, not a gate.
2. **Pull thresholds out of roles.** Move “≤ 0.2 mm”, “≥ 0.90 optimality” from role labels into **step requirements**; leave roles clean (assignments).
3. **Pin contexts.** Add the bounded context name to each capability table (“Capability Sheet — AssemblyLine\_2025”).
4. **Snapshot validity.** Add a “valid through” column (software version or calibration horizon).
5. **Separate recipe/execution.** Move flowcharts under **MethodDescription**, runs under **Work**; link the capability to the **holder** with references to those specs.
## Consequences

| Benefits                                                                                           | Trade‑offs / mitigations                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Truthful planning.** Schedulers and managers can ask “can do?” independently of “assigned now?” | **Extra column in tables.** Adding scope/measures/valid‑through is a small burden that repays itself in fewer reschedules. |
| **Safer gating.** Steps gate on both role and ability; fewer silent failures.                      | **Two checks instead of one.** Keep the checklist simple: *badge + bounds*.                                                   |
| **Clear service design.** Services become explicit promises built on visible abilities.            | **Temptation to over‑promise.** Keep service SLOs within demonstrated capability measures.                                    |
| **Clean separation with Dynamics and PBS/SBS.** No more “process” or “function” soup.              | **Some retraining.** Use the litmus tables (from the lexical rules) during onboarding.                                        |
## Relations

* **Builds on:** A.1 Holonic Foundation; A.1.1 `U.BoundedContext`; A.2 Role; A.2.1 `U.RoleAssignment`.
* **Coordinates with:** A.3 (Transformation & role masks); A.15 (Role–Method–Work Alignment).
* **Constrains:** Step design: thresholds belong on steps; BoM/PBS must stay structural.
* **Informs:** `U.PromiseContent` definitional pattern (external promises derive from capabilities); `U.Dynamics` definitional pattern (models used as evidence or predictors); Γ/aggregation (capability of composites is stated at the whole).
* **Lexical guards:** E.10.x **L‑FUNC** (do not call capability “function”); E.10.y **L‑PROC** (do not call capability “process”).
## Didactic quick cards (reuse in specs and slides)

* **Capability = can do (within bounds).** assignment ≠ ability ≠ recipe ≠ execution ≠ promise.
* **Gate every critical step with two checks:** *badge (Role assignment)* + *bounds (Capability)*.
* **Write the Context on every claim:** context name, **WorkScope**, measures, **QualificationWindow/valid-through**.
