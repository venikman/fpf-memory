# Migration debt from A.2.6 (Scope, ClaimScope, WorkScope)
> Preface node `heading:migration-debt-from-a-2-6-scope-claimscope-workscope:60590`

## Content

## Deprecations (normative)

The following terms **MUST NOT** name scope objects in normative text, guards, or conformance blocks:

* *applicability*, *envelope*, *generality*, *capability envelope*, *validity* (as a characteristic name).

Use instead:

* **`U.ClaimScope`** (*Claim scope*, nick **G**) for epistemes;
* **`U.WorkScope`** (*Work scope*) for capabilities;
* **`U.Scope`** only when explaining the abstract mechanism (not in guards).
## Affected locations and required edits (normative)

Editors SHALL apply the following replacements:

1. **Part C.2.2 (F–G–R).**

   * Replace any internal definition of “Generality” with a normative reference to **A.2.6 §6.3** (*Claim scope (G)*).
   * Where “abstraction level” is mentioned as G, replace with “Claim scope (where the claim holds)”; keep **AT** (AbstractionTier) only as optional didactics (non‑G).
   * Ensure composition examples use **intersection/SpanUnion** for G, not ordinal “more/less general”.

2. **Part C.2.3 (Formality F).**

   * No change to F itself.
   * Any example that implies “raising F widens G” MUST be rephrased: F changes expression form; G changes only via **ΔG**.

3. **Part A.2.2 (Capabilities).**

   * Replace “capability envelope/applicability” with **`U.WorkScope`**.
   * Method–Work gates MUST test **Work scope covers JobSlice**, with **measures** and **qualification windows** bound.

4. **Part B (Bridges & CL).**

   * Add a note: **CL penalties apply to R**, not to **F/G**; mapping MAY recommend **narrowing** the mapped scope (best practice).

5. **Part E (Lexicon).**

   * Add entries for **Claim scope (G)**, **Work scope**, **Scope** (mechanism).
   * Mark listed deprecated terms as **legacy aliases** allowed only in explanatory notes.

6. **ESG & Method–Work templates.**

   * Replace any “applicability”/“envelope” guard phrasing with **ScopeCoverage** (see §10).
   * Require explicit **`Γ_time`** selectors in all scope‑sensitive guards.
## Migration playbook (informative)

1. **Inventory** scope‑like phrases across your Context (search: applicability, envelope, generality, capability envelope, valid\*).
2. **Classify** each occurrence as **Claim scope** (episteme) or **Work scope** (capability); replace any “scope characteristic(s)” with “scope object”, “scope type”, or “USM scope object” depending on sentence grammar.
3. **Rewrite** guards to use `Scope covers TargetSlice` + explicit **`Γ_time`**; remove “latest”.
4. **Publish** any required **Bridges** with **CL** for Cross‑context usage.
5. **Document** ΔG changes separately from evidence freshness (R).
## Backwards compatibility (informative)

Legacy artifacts MAY keep their historical phrasing in body prose. All **guards, conformance checklists, and state assertions** MUST be rewritten to the USM terms and semantics.
## Change Log (normative migration record)

* **A.2.6 introduced.** Defines `U.ContextSlice`, `U.Scope`, `U.ClaimScope (G)`, `U.WorkScope`; sets algebra and guard patterns.
* **Deprecated labels.** “applicability / envelope / generality / capability envelope / validity” as characteristic names.
* **Edits required.** C.2.2 (G = Claim scope), A.2.2 (Work scope for capabilities), Part B (CL→R note), Part E (Lexicon updates), ESG/Method–Work guard templates (ScopeCoverage + `Γ_time`).
* **No change.** C.2.3 (F) unchanged; its examples updated only for wording consistency.
